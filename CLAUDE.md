## Current state (2026-06-01)

- **Android 8/9 black-screen FIXED + SAF export device-verified (2026-06-01, `a6389d0`).** Setting up an API-28 (Android 9) emulator to verify SAF export surfaced a far bigger bug: **the app totally black-screened on Android 8/9.** Two causes, both gated on the old System WebView those OS versions ship (Chromium **69** on a non-Play-updated API-28). **(1) Modern SYNTAX:** esbuild had **no `--target`**, so bundles shipped raw `?.` + `??` (Chromium 80+ syntax) → hard **parse errors** on WebView 69 that kill the whole bundle (cascade: "COLLECTIONS is not defined" etc.) → black screen. Fix: `--target=chrome69` on `build:b/c/d` (verified bundles now have zero `?.`/`??`). Chose 69 not lower because the app also uses `Array.flatMap` (Chromium-69 *runtime* API) — below 69 it'd fail anyway, so 69 is the honest functional floor. **(2) Runtime APIs newer than 69** (`--target` can't transpile these): a feature-detected polyfill block, **first `<script>` in index.html**, shims `globalThis` (C71), `Promise.allSettled` (C76, boot-critical — store hydration), `Promise.any` (C85). No-op on modern WebViews. **Device-verified on the emulator:** app boots to a fully-rendered home (was 100% black), zero logcat JS errors; **SAF export confirmed end-to-end** — Export → `ACTION_CREATE_DOCUMENT` → DocumentsUI picker (pre-filled filename) → SAVE wrote `/sdcard/Download/votreader-backup-2026-06-01.json`, a complete v2 payload (all 17 stores incl. history + marked-as-read; 9 top-level keys) — the exact case the old code rejected with `error:requires_android_10`. The two-tier storage rows ("Total app data" / "Your data") also verified rendering on API 28. **Emulator setup (reusable):** cmdline-tools downloaded to the SDK; AVD `vot_api28` (API 28, Pixel 5, google_apis x86_64); boot headless via `emulator -avd vot_api28`. tsc clean; 1522 vitest; bundle-c unchanged (no modern syntax present).

- **index.html ghost-comment purge — 1001 → 522 lines (2026-06-01, `f6355a5`).** Pure housekeeping, zero behavior change. The file had accreted 100+ `/* X → extracted to src/... */` breadcrumb comments + 36 banner headers — the tombstones left behind by every Q2-P9 module extraction. That phase is long closed and git history preserves the provenance, so all 479 net comment lines were deleted. What remains is only real code: the HTML head (CSP, fonts, meta, boot script), the lazy-loader factory + `__finishBibleInit`/`__finishVotInit` boot wiring, the still-inline data constants (`CANON_SUBTITLES`, `SCRIPTURE_GENRES`, `TRANSLATION_OPTIONS`/`SCRIPTURE_LAYOUT_OPTIONS`/`ARROW_LAYOUT_OPTIONS`, `READING_SCREENS`, `HL_COLORS`, `SRCH_*`, `STUDY_ABBREVS`, month/weekday names, `HIDDEN_MANNA_TITLES`, `_OT_BOOKS_INLINE`), and the bundle-a/b/c/d load sequence + window mirror + render. **Corrected a stale doc number along the way:** CLAUDE.md's file-structure tree had claimed index.html was "4,043 lines" (a pre-extraction figure that never got updated) — it had actually been ~1000 for a long time and is now 522. Verified: `npm run build` + 1522 vitest + tsc + eslint all clean. The inline data constants are extractable to modules (`READING_SCREENS`→`tabs.js`, `HIDDEN_MANNA_TITLES`→`letter-linking.js`, etc.) but were left in place — they're real code, not noise, and reasonable to keep in the boot file; the ghost comments were the actual debt.
- **Garden zoom-on-page-flip fix (2026-05-31).** After zooming in on any Garden page, every subsequent page flip (forward or backward) rendered the new page zoomed way in — even on pages never manually zoomed. **Root cause:** `resetZoom()` used `webView.zoomBy(1f / vm.currentScale)` to undo the pinch, but `vm.currentScale` (tracked via `onScaleChanged`) raced with content changes and `zoomBy` doesn't reliably produce exactly 1.0x due to floating-point/clamping, so the tracked scale diverged from reality and every subsequent reset made it worse. **Fix: replaced WebView's built-in zoom with JS-managed CSS `transform` zoom.** `GardenView.jsx` now handles pinch-to-zoom, single-finger pan (when zoomed), double-tap toggle (1x ↔ 2.5x), and mouse-wheel zoom entirely via touch/wheel event listeners + `transform: translate(…) scale(…)` on the `<img>` element. Zoom state (`scale`, `tx`, `ty`) lives in React refs for zero-re-render gesture performance; `applyZoom()` writes directly to the DOM. On page change, reset is trivial: `scale=1, tx=0, ty=0` — no native bridge, no race conditions. `touch-action: none` added to `.garden-image-area` to prevent browser defaults from conflicting. The native `setZoomEnabled`/`resetZoom` bridge methods are no longer called from GardenView (WebView zoom stays disabled). Zoom-toward-pinch-center math: `tx' = midX - (startMidX - startTx) * (newScale / startScale)`. Translation clamped so the image can't pan past its edges. Pinch-to-pan transition (lift one finger mid-pinch → continues as pan) handled. Max zoom 5x. Preview-verified: zoom resets to 1x on every forward/backward page flip, including after simulated 3x and 4x zooms; zero console errors. Lint + typecheck + 1522 tests clean. **OWED:** device-verify on Android (the platform where the bug manifests).
- **Garden image lag — native disk cache (Android, 2026-05-31, `9483500`).** After the CSP fix restored Garden loading, Android page-turns lagged (desktop PWA snappy). Root cause: the GitHub release URL 302-redirects to a signed `release-assets.githubusercontent.com` asset with `Cache-Control: no-cache`, so the WebView re-downloaded each image **+ re-did the redirect hop on every navigation**. JS can't cache them (no CORS → `fetch` fails) and the PWA Service Worker never runs on Android (`sw-register` skips it), so the fix is native: **`GardenImageCache`** in `MainActivity`'s `shouldInterceptRequest` serves from / populates `cacheDir/garden/`. **Keyed by PAGE NUMBER (tier stripped)** so re-reading at a new quality **overwrites** the same page — never N copies per tier (user's explicit rule); count bounded ≤209. **Cap 800 MB**, sized from on-device measurement (Ultra ≈3.5 MB/page avg, max 8.3 MB → full 209-page read ≈720 MB) so a full read of *any* tier incl. Ultra never evicts mid-browse — the cap is a pure backstop. (An initial 260 MB cap was caught churning ~64% of an Ultra read and raised — caught because I measured on-device, not from the tier's advertised "~680 MB".) Atomic tmp+rename writes; all failures degrade to null (WebView loads the image itself, so a cache bug can't *prevent* loading); per-page locks dedupe concurrent fetches. **Device-verified on `51071FDAP000C8` (Ultra tier):** cache accumulated to 176 files / 586 MB with **zero eviction + zero errors** (the old cap pinned at ~72/259 MB and churned), page-keyed real JPEGs, no `.tmp` leftovers, page 1 cached for instant revisit. 6 `GardenImageCacheTest` cases; Kotlin compile + `testDebugUnitTest` + JaCoCo green. **Kotlin-only** — the Garden CSP asset fix shipped in `1423bda`. App data (regenerable, OS-evictable `cacheDir`), not in export / not in "your data".
- **Storage forensics + 3 fixes — search-cache leak, Garden CSP, two-tier storage display (2026-05-31, `1423bda`).** Triggered by a user report ("export 676 KB but Settings says 243 MB used"). **adb on-device forensics** (run-as into `app_webview/Default/IndexedDB`) found the **export was correct** (journal-media DB = exactly 2 live records = the 1 image + 1 audio; 676 KB is complete) and isolated three real, separate issues. **(1) Search-index cache leak — the 243 MB.** `search.js` cached a full ~21 MB serialized FlexSearch index per `dataSignature()` (changes on corpus edit / SCHEMA_VERSION bump / translation switch) and `cachePut` **never evicted** superseded generations → ~10 stale ~21 MB copies in `vot-search-cache`. Fix: `saveToCache` self-evicts (keep only the just-written sig + sibling corpus's current sig); new `evictStaleCache`/`cacheKeys`/`cacheDelete` + `purgeStaleCache(code)` on the public API. **Purge runs at app boot** via a one-time `app.jsx` effect (`96d62d6`) — NOT gated behind `VotSearch.init()` (which only fires when the user opens Search, so the reclaim could sit undone for days); the cheap standalone IDB key-deletion is safe at startup since it never builds/loads the index. **Then fixed a boot-timing bug (`a0be528`):** the purge first kept `dataSignature(code,corpus)`, but `dataSignature` reads the LAZY corpus globals (`BOOKS`/`MATTHEW`/`LETTERS_*`) absent at boot → boot-time sig `…mt0…bk0.0` never matched the real cached keys `…mt28…bk66.929`, so on-device it reclaimed NOTHING (240 MB stayed). Rewrote `purgeStaleCache` to be **signature-INDEPENDENT** — `cacheEntries()` parses each key's `cp:<corpus>` segment + `savedAt`, keep only the NEWEST per corpus. **DEVICE-VERIFIED** on `51071FDAP000C8`: cold launch logged "boot purge removed 21 stale index generation(s)"; search-cache **240 MB/22 files → 24 MB/2 files**, total IndexedDB **242 MB → 27 MB (~215 MB freed)**; survivors are the live Scriptures (20.1 MB) + Volumes (3.1 MB) indexes; app healthy. **(2) Garden "failed to load" — CSP, not connection.** GitHub now 302-redirects release assets to `release-assets.githubusercontent.com`, absent from `img-src` → WebView blocked the redirect. Added `release-assets.` + `objects.githubusercontent.com` to `img-src` + `connect-src`; dropped the dead `raw.githubusercontent.com`. Preview-proven (`<img>` loads 1688×2160 under corrected CSP). **fetch() of these assets fails (no CORS)** → JS blob cache impossible; **native Android per-page Garden cache shipped separately (`9483500`, see the dedicated bullet above)**, device-verified. Garden's JS-side `gardenImageCache` is in-memory-only (session heap), never persisted → never in the 243 MB nor the export. **(3) Two Settings storage rows** (`src/utils/user-data-size.js`): **"Total app data"** = `navigator.storage.estimate().usage` (matches OS settings — corpus cache + search cache + thumbnails + everything); **"Your data"** = `measureUserData()` summing UTF-8 JSON bytes across the 17 user-content stores + journal-media blob bytes = exactly the Export set. Garden/search/thumbnail caches **excluded** from "your data" (app data, regenerable). Verified: rows render "About 27.7 MB of 11.5 GB" vs "About 1.2 KB". **Backup coverage confirmed complete** — reading history (`vot-history`) + marked-as-read (`readItems` in `vot-state`) are both already exported. tsc/build/lint clean; **1522 vitest (+10)**; coverage floor holds (59.13/49.2/63.29/63.35). Garden CSP loading + native disk cache + boot-purge reclaim are all device-verified (see the Garden + boot-purge handling above). **Investigated + dismissed (2026-05-31):** the JS `gardenImageCache` keys by `tier:page` and is never cleared in-session — flagged as a possible heap-growth concern, but MEASURED in preview: 836 `Image()` objects (worst case, all 209 pages × 4 tiers) added **0 MB** measurable JS heap (the objects are tiny handles; decoded-bitmap memory lives in the browser's own image cache, which it evicts under pressure independently). Adding eviction would also break the background crawl, which uses cache presence as its "already-fetched" done-marker (eviction → infinite re-prime). So NOT a real issue; left as-is by design.
- **Native #1 — SAF export (user-chosen folder, works on Android 8/9) — DONE 2026-05-31.** Closes the last HIGH-priority data-safety gap. **The bug:** export went through `saveToDownloads` → `StorageManager.writeJsonToDownloads`, which hard-returns `error:requires_android_10` on API < 29 (the MediaStore.Downloads collection didn't exist pre-Q). With **minSdk 26**, Android 8/9 users **could not export at all** — and Export/Import is the ONLY backup (`allowBackup=false`), so that was silent data-loss exposure. **The fix (one change, both asks):** replaced the Downloads-only writer with **SAF `ACTION_CREATE_DOCUMENT`** (`AppInterface.saveToFile` → `BridgeHost.launchExportPicker` → `MainActivity.exportPickerLauncher` (`ActivityResultContracts.CreateDocument("application/json")`) → `StorageManager.writeTextToUri(uri, content)`). SAF is API 19+ so it works on every supported device, AND it inherently shows a **"choose folder + filename" picker** (the user-picks-destination ask) — folder, SD card, or cloud provider, with the filename `votreader-backup-YYYY-MM-DD.json` pre-filled. **No new permission** (SAF is permission-free → aligns with the no-security-risks policy). **Async contract** (mirrors import): `saveToFile` is fire-and-forget; outcome arrives via `window.__onExportComplete("ok" | "error:<reason>" | "cancelled")` (new `JsEvent.ExportComplete`). SettingsScreen installs the one-shot callback before launching; "ok" → "Backup saved." toast, "cancelled" → silent, error → retry toast. Web impl keeps the Blob+anchor download but now also fires `__onExportComplete`. **Data completeness + compression were ALREADY correct and left untouched** (verified, not assumed): the v2 payload exports all 14 IDB stores + 3 flag stores + ALL journal media (images AND audio) base64'd; images are stored compressed at maxDim 1600 / JPEG q0.8 (`JournalMediaStore.compressImage`), native audio is AAC 96 kbps / 44.1 kHz, web audio is opus — re-encoding baked JPEG/AAC would only degrade, so no recompression was added. **Verified:** web export end-to-end through the rebuilt bundle (real `saveToFile` → Blob text byte-matches payload, suggested filename, `__onExportComplete('ok')`, 0 console errors); JS 84/84 platform-bridge + 1512 full suite; Kotlin `:app:testDebugUnitTest :app:jacocoTestCoverageVerification` BUILD SUCCESSFUL (StorageManager `writeTextToUri` tests replace the old Downloads tests; AppInterface `saveToFile` delegation tests; FakeBridgeHost `launchExportPicker`; JsBridgeTest pins `__onExportComplete`). **OWED:** device-verify the picker + cancel path on a real Android **8/9** specifically (the case the fix exists for) — folded into the W6 walk; `tools/n1-smoke-walk.md` updated.
- **W8 closed — W8.3 scripture JSDoc types DONE, W8.2 @layer rewrite RETIRED, 5 redundant `!important` removed (2026-05-31).** Final-stretch W8 cleanup. **W8.3 (`dfadf85`):** `@param`/`@returns` typedefs on the five scripture primitives (`parseRefStr`/`findBook`/`parseScriptureRef`/`resolveVerseText`/`lookupVersesFromBooks`) + `src/data/scripture-resolution.js` added to the tsconfig include. **Honest caveat the plan got wrong:** tsconfig is `strict:false` → `strictNullChecks` OFF, so the `|null` returns are *shape-checked + documented*, NOT null-enforced at call sites; real value is wrong-field/typo detection via checkJs. tsc clean, 1511 tests. **W8.2 (`00d215e`) — the `@layer` rewrite was investigated and RETIRED, not executed.** Premise was stale (Q6.9 already adjudicated + KEPT the load-bearing `!important`; count was 19 not 24) and the rewrite is net-negative: `@layer` fails CLOSED on an old System WebView (the whole wrapped sheet is dropped → unstyled app), unlike the graceful degradation of every other CSS feature we use (`var()`, `mask-image`, `:focus-visible`), for zero user-facing gain. **Safe remnant shipped instead:** removed the 5 genuinely *redundant* `!important` from the color-picker chrome (`.sel-color-underline`/`.sel-color-squiggle`/`.sel-color-clear`/`[data-color=blank]` ×2 — proven no-ops in preview via computed-style probes: equal-specificity-later or higher-specificity-no-competitor), and *documented* the 3 genuinely load-bearing annotation ones (`.hl-underline`/`.hl-squiggle` `background:none`, `.hl-note.is-active` gold wash) with the specificity reason they exist (they beat `body.light .hl-<color>` at 0,2,0). **`!important` 19 → 14**; the rest are load-bearing state/drag/spacing/palette-guard overrides, now commented as intentional. Preview-verified zero visual change (swatch borders + content marks byte-identical dark+light, 0 console errors). **W8 is effectively closed** — only the optional app.jsx typing pass remains (not a blocker). SW cache re-synced (app.css is a core asset). See PLAN.txt §W8.
- **Overlap-precedence — most-recent annotation wins cleanly (2026-05-31, `c7d37ba`).** When annotations overlap (e.g. a yellow highlight over the first words of a blue note), the more-recently-`created` VISIBLE one now shows in the overlap slice — a CLEAN override (the older slice renders `hl-blank` = transparent `rgba(0,0,0,0)`), NOT the arbitrary alpha-blend the old nesting order produced ("yellow *instead of* blue"). Both annotations stay stored; the older still paints everywhere it isn't overridden; **the note icon ALWAYS survives** even where a note's highlight is fully covered (only the paint drops to `hl-blank`, never the `hl-note` marker — per the user's explicit correction). A **blank** annotation has no paint to win with, so it never suppresses a color beneath it (blank is transparent → the layer below shows). Driven by the existing `created` stamp — **no schema change / no migration**. `annotation-engine.jsx` gained 4 pure helpers (`annVisible`/`annAbove`/`coveredSubRanges`/`renderSubRanges`); BOTH render paths updated — HighlightableText (React sweep-line: per-slice `topVisible` paints, rest suppressed) + applyDOMHighlights (imperative: each range split into paint/suppress sub-ranges, newest sorts **innermost** so it paints on top AND is the tap target; dropped the dead `groupCounts` tally). Non-overlapping annotations render byte-identically. **Verified end-to-end in preview through the bundle** (real yellow-over-blue: "Hello" clean yellow + " world" blue, text intact, both `data-hl-id` present) + 22 vitest cases incl. the staggered-overlap trap (recency, not text position, decides). `renderer/` is outside the coverage scope. **Tests 1483 → 1505.**
- **Annotation UX overhaul + native tap + OneDrive build-lock fix — 2026-05-31.** All committed + pushed + CI-green; device-verified on `51071FDAP000C8` (`adb` at `C:/Users/corbi/AppData/Local/Android/Sdk/platform-tools/`).
  - **(1) OneDrive build-lock — FIXED (`8e848fa`).** `app/` is reached via the legacy OneDrive junction, so OneDrive attribute-locked `app/build` and broke every *incremental* gradle build (`AccessDenied` on cleanup → "can't rebuild apk on studio"). `app/build.gradle.kts` now reads `vot.buildDir` from `local.properties` (machine-local, gitignored) and relocates `layout.buildDirectory` there — currently `D:\VOTReader-build\app`, OUTSIDE the synced tree. Additive + CI-safe (no key → default `app/build`). **⚠️ The debug APK is now at `D:\VOTReader-build\app\outputs\apk\debug\app-debug.apk`, NOT `app/build/...`.** Android Studio needs a one-time *Sync Project with Gradle Files* to follow it. (Junction removal via `rmdir` was denied while OneDrive/Studio held handles; the redirect sidesteps the lock entirely. NEVER `Remove-Item -Recurse` the junction — it follows into D: and deletes real files.)
  - **(2) Tap-to-open-chip on Android — FIXED (`5edfec7`).** Android WebView swallows a tap on selectable `<mark>` text (no `click`, no bubbling `touchend` — only long-press reached the chip). Research-backed fix: a native `GestureDetector` in MainActivity (`@SuppressLint ClickableViewAccessibility`, returns `false` → consumes nothing) detects a single tap, converts device→CSS px (`/ displayMetrics.density`; zoom is disabled so it's exact), and calls `window.__nativeTapAnnotation(cssX, cssY)` (new `JsEvent.AnnotationTap`) which hit-tests via `elementFromPoint` + opens the chip through the shared `routeAnnotationTap`. Selection / multi-verse drag / scroll are byte-for-byte untouched. (Two failed web-only attempts — `click` handler, raw touch listeners — preceded it.) Chip y-offset removed → default position.
  - **(3) Squiggle style (`6705374`).** Third annotation style alongside highlight + underline — an always-on wavy underline (`.hl-squiggle`); wired through both renderers + the toolbar's 3-button style toggle.
  - **(4) Notes rework — Step B (`e4e42dd`).** **Note-ness DECOUPLED from `kind`.** `kind` = visual style only {highlight, underline, squiggle}; **note-ness = a NoteStore entry** (drives the icon + opens the sheet). `color` now includes **`blank`** (completely invisible; highlight-style only — a note with no visual overhead). **Legacy `kind:'note'` renders as a blank-highlight + icon → NO data migration, existing notes byte-for-byte unchanged on disk + visually identical.** NoteSheet gained the toolbar's style toggle + color row + a blank swatch (outline + diagonal-slash glyph). **`NoteDefaultStore`** (new IDB store `vot-note-default`, additive **schema v2→v3**) persists the last-used note style+color; cold-start = blank highlight, and changing a note's style/color updates the default. Note cards (`NoteRow`) dropped the 1-line/2-line CSS clamp so short/medium notes show in FULL; only >160 chars collapses behind "Show more" (closed the "donut hole" where clipped text had no button). Renderer reuses `hl-note` as the has-note marker; `.hl-note.is-active` = faint gold wash (the old wavy is now `.hl-squiggle`). Side-scroll fade on all 3 color rows.
  - **(5) Multi-verse notes + toolbar viewport clamp (`e792337`).** The Note button is no longer gated behind `!mv` — a multi-verse / multi-paragraph selection (a whole chapter or letter) can become a single note (`handleNote`'s multiVerse branch already spanned every `[data-hl-key]`). And SelectionToolbar now measures its rendered width in a `useLayoutEffect` and clamps `x` to the viewport (8px margins) — fixes the menu running off the screen edge for selections near the margin (the 320px estimate underclamped the 360px-max toolbar).
  - **Tests 1472 → 1478; coverage holds (59.18/49.19/63.1/63.41 ≥ 59/49/62/63 floor).** **B2 — DONE (`9247c73`):** the chip now carries a **Style** switcher (highlight/underline/squiggle via `AnnotationStore.convertGroup`) beside Remove·Color·Convert-to-note, so an existing *regular* highlight can be restyled straight from the chip (a note restyle also updates `NoteDefaultStore`, mirroring the sheet); 6 vitest cases + preview-verified (highlight→squiggle through the bundle). Still open: W6 device walks, W10 a11y. (Native #1 SAF export DONE 2026-05-31 — see the lead bullet; W8.2 CSS @layer RETIRED 2026-05-31 — net-negative; W8.3 scripture JSDoc types DONE — see the W8 bullet below.)
- **Footnote gold-render pile-strip — 2026-05-31 (`078024f` → `66f9aba` → `b0415d4`).** User mandate: *every* footnote verse number renders gold "because that's how the data is, not because a patch transforms white→gold" — and "fix the data, not the parser." **Root cause:** the renderer turns verse numbers gold only when `splitIntoVerses` splits a value on its EXPLICIT markers (decimal "N." or Unicode superscript); the marker-less fallback **guessing** strategies (sentence-split + genealogy-comma + chunk-distribution) produced the white / duplicated / mis-numbered renders the user screenshotted (2 Peter CJB dup, Deut 27 all-white). **Fix = strip the pile + mark the data:** (1) `scripture-parse.js` — **Strategy 1 + 2 + chunk-distribution DELETED**; a marker-less multi-verse value now degrades to a single start-verse block (no guessing). (2) all remaining "N." markers inserted across letters-flock / volume-two / volume-three / wtlb-scriptures via `tools/mark-footnote-verses.js` (sourced from the repo's own NKJV; byte-for-byte marker-strip assertion). **Markers go BEFORE a leading quote** — Strategy 0's whitespace-only lookbehind needs `17. “But`, NOT `“17. But` (a Luke 15 regression, caught + fixed in `66f9aba`). Annotated keys cleaned (Deut 27:16-26, Zech 6:9-13 ×2). (3) **`validateFootnoteMarkers`** gate in `tools/validate-schemas.js` (wired into the data gate — pre-commit + CI) flags any multi-verse value whose decimal markers don't fully split (the white eyesore), tolerating superscript excerpts + prose — **769 footnote values, 0 errors.** **Verified in preview:** the *bundled* `splitIntoVerses` fully-splits every real WTLB case (Luke 15 → 22 segments, 0 white leftover); `.verse-sup` = gold `rgb(232,192,80)`. **Tests 1478 → 1483** (+5 marker-gate cases; scripture-parse tests rewritten for the marker-less fallback). **CORPUS_VERSION c3→c4→c5.** **VERIFIED 2026-05-31** through the shipped bundle: `splitIntoVerses('15. … 16. … 17. …', 'Luke 15:15-17')` → 3 segments with `vNum` 15/16/17; a marker-less value degrades to `null` (no guessing); `.verse-sup` = gold `rgb(232,192,80)`; data gate 0 errors. The freshly-installed APK bundles this exact code, so Android renders gold. Done.
- **OPEN THREADS / next-session pickup (2026-05-29).** Nothing blocking; all work below is committed + CI-green + deployed. Loose ends: **(a) PWA icon, Windows reopen — RESOLVED 2026-05-29:** user confirmed the icon is correct on reinstall+reopen (no `theme_color` gold border). Transparent + maskable icons sufficed; the full-bleed-`"any"` fallback was not needed. **(b) CORPUS_VERSION bumped c1→c2** this session so the Hebrews corpus fix actually reaches existing web PWAs — the corpus cache only busts on a CORPUS_VERSION change; **any future books.js/matthew.js/VOT-corpus edit needs a manual bump** (see [[corpus-version-bump]]). **(c) Format-E — DONE 2026-05-29** (see the dedicated bullet below): the 7 `bible-*.js` + `matthew.js` + `matthew-nkjv.js` are now schema-gated; 0 errors strict-mode. **(d) Native improvements:** #1 SAF export fallback — **DONE 2026-05-31** (SAF create-document picker; works on Android 8/9; see the lead current-state bullet; device-verify owed in W6) · #2 async screenshot (optional polish) · #3 native crash-view a11y → W10. **(e) Phases remaining:** **W7 COMPLETE 2026-05-29** (`raw()` freeze ✓ · schema versioning ✓ · hlTick removal ✓ · **W7.4** DiagnosticLog ✓ · **W7.5** buildScreenRoutes — RESOLVED no-build, explicit signature AFFIRMED (bundling doesn't reduce coupling; user-ratified) · **W7.6** OPFS — RESOLVED deferred with profiling data (IDB put p90 ~2ms, ~100× under the build threshold) — see the W7 bullet below). **W8 IN PROGRESS** (type coverage + CSS @layer) — recon overturned the plan's "82-file flood" estimate: ~71 errors total, almost all mechanical. **W8.1 COMPLETE** (the whole ui tree is now in the typecheck gate): tier 1 = `renderer/` (TreeWalker 4th-arg drops + Text/Element casts); tier 2 = `ui/` + `components/` (Element casts for `.closest`/`.dataset`; props typedefs incl. `key?` on same-file-rendered list rows BookmarkRow/LinkRow/JournalBlockView — cross-file components are `any` so accept `key`, same-file ones use their real inferred type and need it; ConfirmStrip/HydrationGate optional-prop typedefs that also cleared the matching test errors; test-file casts for DOM members + globalThis mocks). **One documented `@ts-expect-error`** in ScreenLayout: `__scrollEl` is a mutable `let` GLOBAL (index.html ~515) read by use-scroll-memory/use-thumbnails — it is lexical, NOT a window property, so the generator's blanket `declare const` mis-types it; `window.__scrollEl=` was caught as a would-be regression (different binding) and reverted to the correct bare assignment + suppress. tsc green with utils/stores/hooks/renderer/ui/components in scope; 1467 tests pass; live-smoke clean. REMAINING: **app.jsx** (the App() composition root — still excluded, optional separate pass) · **W8.2** CSS @layer — RETIRED 2026-05-31 (net-negative; see the W8 bullet) · W10 (accessibility) · W6 (device walks = grand finale; `adb` at `C:/Users/corbi/AppData/Local/Android/Sdk/platform-tools/`).
- **Data integrity + KJV regen — 2026-05-29.** (1) **Missing Hebrews verses restored.** The W9 validator flagged internal gaps (10:15-18, 11:12-31, 13:18-19); a cross-translation audit then caught trailing gaps (10:26-39, 12:16-29) the per-file contiguity check can't see. All 54 NKJV verses inserted from user-provided text (smart-quote house style matched); Hebrews now whole, full books.js-vs-KJV audit 0-missing. (2) **`bible-kjv.js` regenerated** via `tools/regen-kjv.js` (fixed CommonJS→ESM) from getbible.net `/v2/kjv/` = clean eBible eng-kjv (1769 Blayney, v3.1, GPL) — drops inline translator glosses ("Boaz: Gr. Booz") + the Esther-10 apocrypha. 31,102 verses; Ruth 2:1 clean (in-app verified); standalone-loaded via `loadTranslation` (not bundled). (3) **Cross-translation verse-count validator** — `validateAgainstReference(books, reference)` in `validate-schemas.js` compares Format C verse-sets vs the complete KJV, catching the missing-verse class the per-file check structurally can't; wired into the CLI (books.js + matthew-plain.js vs `BIBLE_KJV`) so the pre-commit/CI gate now catches it. (4) **#4 JaCoCo loud-fail guard** (W7 — empty class-tree → loud failure instead of silent zero-coverage pass) + **pre-commit hardening** (now stages the lazy corpus bundles `a-bible`/`a-matthew`/`a-vot`, and runs the schema validator when the validator itself changes). **Tests: 1366** (+10 cross-reference cases).
- **W9 Format-E validators — LANDED 2026-05-29.** Closes the Format-E pass deferred in the W9.1 continuation; the 3 web-served shapes that postdate the A-D spec are now gated. Exported from `tools/validate-schemas.js`, all wired into the CLI + pre-commit + CI data gate: **`validateTranslationMap`** (the 7 `bible-*.js` verse maps `{bookId:{chapNum:[{n,text}]}}` — non-ascending `n` = error; a gap = warning, since cross-translation versification legitimately differs); **`validateStudyBible`** (`matthew.js` MATTHEW — top-level fields + preface `heading`/`para`/`poetry` blocks reusing the Format A `validateSegments`; sectionless chapters with `verses` + `scriptures`/`votNotes`/`links` annotation layers); **`validateScriptureDict`** (`matthew-nkjv.js` ref→text dict — compound `|`/em-dash values are legit, so only the value TYPE is constrained). Shared `validateVerseArray` helper (Format C keeps its own inline check, whose message contract is pinned by tests). **First real catch — kept the data, fixed the validator:** `matthew.js` ch5 `votNotes[0].vol` is `null` (the source "The Blessed" is a non-volume collection already named in `letter`), so `vol` is modeled nullable via a `'string'`-vs-`'string?'` field spec rather than relaxing all fields. **Strict run: 1531 items, 0 errors, 38 warnings** in ~0.9s — every warning is a legit critical-text omission (Acts 8:37, Rom 16:24, Mark 9:44/46, John 5:4, Matt 17:21/18:11/23:14) present only in ASV/BSB/WEB and absent in KJV/YLT. **Tests 1366 → 1421 (+55; `validate-schemas.test.js` now 171 cases).** Still deferred: a whole-missing-chapter cross-check (chapter-count diffs are versification noise, per the prior handoff).
- **W7 — code quality hardening (COMPLETE 2026-05-29).** Closed every remaining code-quality critique; one commit per sub-item (PLAN.txt §W7 has the exit criteria). **W7.2 raw() immutability — LANDED:** `CachedStore.raw()` now returns a shallow-FROZEN COPY of the cache, not the live object. The plan's literal `Object.freeze(this._load())` was a trap — `_load()` returns the LIVE `_cache`, so freezing it would freeze the working object and throw on the next in-place `add()`/`push()`; raw() freezes a COPY instead, leaving the live cache mutable for named methods. Shallow (nested refs shared — named methods are the write path); snapshot semantics; zero prod callers (pure footgun removal). +5 vitest incl. the don't-freeze-the-live-cache regression; **tests 1421 → 1426.** (#4 JaCoCo loud-fail already landed 2026-05-29.) **W7.1a legacy-migration retirement — LANDED:** rather than port the two pre-framework migrations into the new versioned system, they're RETIRED (user's call — live data is already in-shape, so a clean foundation beats old-shape-compat baggage). `migrateAnnotations` (the pre-W2 `vot-highlights` bootstrap) DELETED along with its orphaned `vot-ann-migrated` flag/IDB-store/skip-list/export plumbing; `LinkStore._normalize` slimmed to a malformed-record guard (the `{a,b}→{source,target}` conversion stripped, the real-data drop kept). tests dipped 1426 → 1406 (−20 legacy-migration cases) then back to 1426: removing above-average-covered dead code nicked the coverage floor (a math artifact, not erosion), so — per the gate's "never lower" rule — it was restored by covering real untested in-scope logic (link-store's query/mutation API + `utils/dates.js` relativeDate/timeAgo). **Lesson logged:** pre-commit runs `test` (no coverage); CI runs `test:coverage` — run the latter locally before pushing a test-count change. **W7.1b versioned-migration framework — LANDED:** `CachedStore` takes a per-store `schemaVersion` (default 1) + `migrations` map; `_migrateIfNeeded` runs the chain once on hydration when the meta-tracked version trails, committing data + new version atomically via `IDBAdapter.commitMigration` (one multi-store tx, so data + version never diverge). **Failure-safe:** clone-before-migrate + abort-on-throw / missing-step / commit-fail leaves data intact and the version un-advanced (retries next boot); fully dormant (zero IDB reads) at v1. 14 vitest cases incl. the make-or-break throw-midway / clone-isolation / commit-fail / empty-stamp / no-downgrade. **W7.1 COMPLETE** (retirement + framework). tests 1426 → 1440. **W7.3 hlTick removal — LANDED:** `useDomAnnotationSync` now subscribes to the 4 DOM-relevant stores (Annotation/Note/Link/Bookmark) via `useSyncExternalStore`, so each store's own `_bump()` drives the imperative DOM re-apply directly — the `hlTick` useState + the `window.__bumpHlTick` bridge + ~36 call sites are deleted across **31 files** (also dropped wasteful bumps on Journal/Notebook mutations that don't touch the DOM layer, and swept stale hlTick/localStorage comments incl. 2 hook headers that documented a removed `setHlTick` param). **Live-smoke verified** in preview: a real `AnnotationStore.add` re-ran `applyDOMHighlights` with the bridge absent + zero console errors. tests 1440 → 1439. **W7.4 JS-side DiagnosticLog — LANDED:** new `src/utils/diagnostic-log.js` — a 200-entry FIFO ring buffer mirroring the Kotlin `BoundedLogTree` (in-memory only, cleared on refresh; same content://·file://·/storage|data|… URI/path redaction — note JS `String.replace` needs the `/g` flag where Kotlin's `replace(Regex,…)` is all-by-default). Entry shape `{t,lvl,tag,msg}` matches BoundedLogTree exactly so the two MERGE with no reshaping. API: `warn/error/timing/entries/toJSON/clear` (timing = info-level 'I' for lazy-load durations; warn/error = 'W'/'E'). **`PlatformBridge.getCrashLog` rewired:** Android parses the native log, concats the JS entries, sorts by `t` (malformed-native → JS-only fallback); web returns `DiagnosticLog.toJSON()`. **5 sinks wired:** cached-store `_save` IDB + localStorage write failures → `'store'` (bare-global `typeof` guard, matching the StorageHealth line beside it — cached-store holds no imports by design); storage-health degraded-tier transitions → `'quota'` (transition-gated + degraded-only, so a healthy session logs nothing); index.html `__makeLazyLoader` durations → `'corpus'` timing; sw-register registration failure → `'sw'`; ErrorBoundary `componentDidCatch` → `'render'`. Plus the WakeLock failure path now also feeds DiagnosticLog (honoring its own `W7.4 will migrate` comment). SettingsScreen already read `getCrashLog` + exported `diagnosticLog` + rendered the row — all auto-populate now; copy updated ("warnings, errors, and timings") and the 3 stale `pre-W7.4`/`W7.4 will` forward-refs swept; adjacent fix: index.html's stale "Used by" loader comment gained the `__votCorpus` line. **Live-smoke verified** in preview (clean-slate): DiagnosticLog globalized, real-regex redaction (`content://`+two `/data|/storage` paths → `[uri]`/`[path]`), a real `__loadMatthewCorpus()` produced `corpus matthew 315ms`, merged `getCrashLog` reflects it, 0 console errors. **diagnostic-log.js 100% covered (24 vitest); +4 net platform-bridge (pure-passthrough getCrashLog test → explicit merge tests). tests 1439 → 1467. Coverage floor ratcheted 58/48/62/62 → 59/49/62/63 (functions HELD — 63.02% actual leaves only 0.02 over a 63 floor, too thin). bundle-b → 431.6 KB.** **W7.5 buildScreenRoutes — RESOLVED (NO-BUILD, user-ratified 2026-05-29):** the plan's "group ~130 flat props into 5 bundles" was re-evaluated against the code and REJECTED. The `buildScreenRoutes` header already documented a deliberate user decision (the explicit signature, per [[expose-full-surface]]); the plan's premise was also stale ("47 props" → actually ~130). Key reasoning: bundling does NOT reduce the factory's coupling (it needs every input regardless of packaging — grouping just relabels the same dependency graph), the flat list self-compile-checks (a missing prop is an undefined reference), and the proposed navState/navHandlers split was itself a shape grouping ([[dont-group-by-shape]]). The signature is the honest receipt of clean App() extraction, not a debt. Decision recorded in screen-routes.jsx's header (AFFIRMED comment); any genuinely-cohesive cluster gets revisited during W8 typing ONLY if it makes the typedefs cleaner. **W7.6 OPFS — RESOLVED (DEFERRED with data, 2026-05-29):** profiled `JournalMediaStore.put()` end-to-end in preview (50KB–20MB, empty + 30-record populated). Typical memo range (50KB–1MB) p90 = ~1.6–1.9 ms; 20MB p90 = ~10 ms; populated store no slower — ALL ~100× under the 200 ms threshold that would justify OPFS (and ~10× under it even at a pessimistic 10× budget-device penalty). OPFS's two wins are moot here: writes are already ~2 ms and the app never loads media into JS heap (blob URLs → `<audio>`/`<img>`), so the partial-read win doesn't apply. Building it would add the known Safari data-loss bug (WebKit #250495) + Worker complexity for zero practical gain — contra "user data is paramount." Stay on IDB Blobs. **W7 is now fully closed** (all exit criteria met; the 5 architectural-review critiques are built or evaluated-and-affirmed). **Next phase: W8** (type coverage over ui/ + App(), CSS @layer).
- **Polish pass — 2026-05-28 (W4 CLOSED).** All committed + pushed except where noted. Landed: **#5** `.gitattributes` (LF-normalize `* text=auto eol=lf` + binary protection incl. gradle-wrapper.jar; `c70ecfd`) · **#4** SW same-origin fetch passthrough + **#3** deploy-web `paths:` filter (`4158583`) · **W4.6** `useDocumentTitle` (reuses `describeTab`; `7912bc6`) · **W4.2** `useDesktopKeyboard` (`/`+Ctrl/Cmd+F → `window.__goSearch`, Left/Right click `.chapter-nav-sticky-arrow`; web-only; `1886c13`) · **W4.3** inline-ref `:hover` for `.inline-scrip-ref`/`.letter-link-ref` (`8fc2291`) · **W4.4/W4.5** VERIFY-ONLY (no new code) + 7-case `ui/sheets/SelectionToolbar.test.jsx`. **Counts now: 30 App() hooks, 1366 tests/52 files, app.jsx 774/800.** New hooks (`useDomAnnotationSync`, `useKeyboardInset`, `useDocumentTitle`, `useDesktopKeyboard`) are wired in `_entry-b.js` (import + `Object.assign(window,…)`) and globalized for app.jsx; each has a test.
  - **W4.4 + W4.5 — CLOSED (verify-only).** SelectionToolbar's mount-time effect already listens for `pointerdown`/`pointerup` (unified mouse+touch+pen) + `touchend` + `contextmenu`, so desktop mouse-drag selection and right-click flow through the SAME handlers mobile already used — no new code needed. Confirmed live in a desktop-width preview: drag-select → toolbar (color row + Note/Link/Copy/Share/Search/Bookmark); right-click on a selection → native menu suppressed (`defaultPrevented`) + toolbar; right-click on a highlight mark → suppressed + `__showAnnChip(x,y,hlKey,groupId)` (no toolbar). Locked with the component's first test (`SelectionToolbar.test.jsx`, 7 cases: drag-show, click-no-show, contextmenu-on-selection, mark→chip, note-mark→openNote, icon→openNote, outside-container→native-menu-intact). `ui/` is outside the coverage-measured scope so the coverage floor is unaffected. **W4 is fully closed** — all 7 exit criteria checked in PLAN.txt §W4.
  - **Verify cadence for new hooks:** preview clean-slate is required to load fresh bundles (the SW caches them) — `(async()=>{for(const r of await navigator.serviceWorker.getRegistrations())await r.unregister();for(const k of await caches.keys())await caches.delete(k);location.reload();})()`. Watch CI via `& "C:\Program Files\GitHub CLI\gh.exe" run watch <id> --exit-status` (gh installed+authed as VOTReader). Coverage floor 58/48/62/62 — new hooks in `hooks/` need a test or they erode the branches margin.
- **PWA hardening pass — 2026-05-28.** Made the update loop whole + closed an architectural-drift gap. (1) **Content-hash cache versioning:** SW `CACHE_VERSION` = `v{pkg.version}-{sha256 of CORE_ASSETS, CRLF-normalized}` via `build:sw`, so any core-asset change auto-busts the cache — no manual bumps (`CORPUS_VERSION` stays manual; corpus = ~10 MB re-download). (2) **One-tap updates:** SW `SKIP_WAITING` handler + sw-register waiting-detection → "update available" toast fires at the right time → tap activates + reloads (no full close/reopen). Verified end-to-end in-browser. (3) **app.jsx re-decomposed 838 → 770** (extracted `useDomAnnotationSync` + `useKeyboardInset`) and the **≤800 budget is now a canary gate** (`npm run check:app-size`, pre-commit + CI) — catches the drift class lint/type/test/build miss. (4) **W4.1 desktop column** (centered 760px ≥768px) shipped.
- **CI fully green; W4 kickoff — 2026-05-28.** Both CI jobs now pass for the first time. The long-standing `kotlin-tests` red was `./gradlew` committed non-executable (mode 100644 → Linux CI `exit 126` "Permission denied", *before* any test ran; Windows hides the +x bit so it passed locally + in pre-commit). Fixed via `git update-index --chmod=+x gradlew` (`e605146`). **Keep `gradlew` at mode 100755 — Windows commits can silently drop the +x bit.** (W4 desktop polish has since fully closed — see the lead bullet. **Next phase: W6 cross-platform verification** — Edge/Firefox/Android-device regression + SW update-cycle + real-device smoke walk, all deferred here.)

- **W1 — Cross-platform PWA platform-bridge — CLOSED 2026-05-27.** 35 commits, range `5688f6e..405b382`. Same JS codebase now runs as Android APK (existing) AND desktop PWA. Sub-phases: W0.1 fonts → W1.1 PlatformBridge module → W1.2 (Tier A/B/C) all call-site migration → W1.5 back-button nav (Escape + popstate + modal registry + root-of-stack double-tap toast) → W1.6 cross-browser smoke walk. Full per-commit detail in HISTORY.md. **Bundle delta**: bundle-b 351 → 357 KB. **Vitest**: 595 → 628. Edge + Firefox + Android device regression deferred to W6.
- **W2 storage hardening — CLOSED 2026-05-27.** 28 commits, range `16b8fbd..cbdc625`. Every byte of structured user data now in IndexedDB (database `votreader`, schema v2 with 19 stores); legacy localStorage keys read once via per-store fallback then cleared by W2.4. StorageHealth detection engine + UI banners + write-path wiring + Safari-specific flows all landed. **Tests**: 628 → 1099 (+471). **Bundle delta**: bundle-b 357 → 413 KB; bundle-d 545 → 566.2 KB. **Hydration latency**: 3–8 ms across 17 IDB-backed CachedStores on preview machine (well under the 200 ms mid-range / 500 ms budget targets). Per-sub-phase:
  - **W2.1** (`16b8fbd`) `src/stores/idb-adapter.js` — generic CRUD wrapper with retry-on-AbortError + QuotaExceededError preservation + versionchange handling + onupgradeneeded guard for future schema bumps. 44 vitest cases (fake-indexeddb).
  - **W2.2** (`bea5877`) — `CachedStore` extended with state machine (`pending` / `loaded` / `degraded`), write-queue REBASE on hydration, `_pendingCache` overlay so reads during pending surface user writes immediately, `_shouldDefer` guard pattern for mutation methods, batched single-`_save`+`_bump` after replay. The two documented data-loss vectors (per [[w2-hydration-data-loss]]) are closed.
  - **W2.3** Tier 1 (`c49d658`) — RecentNavStore + HydrationGate component + legacy-LS-fallback path inside `_hydrate` so each store self-migrates on first boot. **Tier 2** (`b72094e`) — 6 warm stores (bookmarks, notebooks, journal × 4). **Tier 3** (`90e64b2`) — annotation + note + link, with LinkStore's legacy `{a,b}→{source,target}` migration extracted to `_normalize()` + post-hydration subscriber. **Polish** (`bdc479e`) — pre-defer stamp ordering on AnnotationStore + BookmarkStore (queue entries no longer pre-mutated), `_notifySubscribers` helper extracted, LinkStore subscriber-semantics comment.
  - **W2.3b** (`cd88255`/`f8df8bd`/`339944f`/`d741695`) — 7 hook-owned direct-LS keys migrated: WelcomedFlagStore + AboutSeenFlagStore + GardenWarningFlagStore + ProphecyCardsStore (`.1`), StateStore with `lsShim` for boot-script sync read of theme + fontStyle (`.2`), HistoryStore via `useSyncExternalStore` refactor (`.3`), HomeOrderStore via IDB schema v1→v2 bump (`.4`, caught in post-W2.3b review — vot-home-order was missing from the original key inventory). 8th key `vot-ann-migrated` stays in LS as a permanent boot-time exception (legacy annotation-migration gate read at module load).
  - **W2.3b polish** (`ec0ffb5`) — `_defaultRef` memoization in `_load()` closes the budget-device infinite-`useSyncExternalStore`-loop bug (degraded-state `getSnapshot` was returning a fresh `copyDefault()` reference each call). AnnotationStore.add spread-copies `ann` before stamping. Steady-state useSavedState test added.
  - **W2.4** (`599073b`) + hotfix (`972944e`) — `clearLegacyLs()` runs after `hydrateAllStores()` in HydrationGate; idempotent via `meta.migrated-v1` flag; LS_SKIP_LIST = `['vot-state', 'vot-ann-migrated']`. Hotfix: clearAllPersonalData made async + awaits IDB `deleteDatabase` before reload (race condition that left `votreader` alive on the next boot); interim guard alerts replace the broken pre-W2.6 export/import.
  - **W2.5** (`d7bacc6`) — `src/utils/format-bytes.js` + `src/hooks/use-storage-info.js`. Two new rows in Settings → Your Data: "Storage" (`navigator.storage.estimate()` + formatBytes) and "Protection" (`navigator.storage.persisted()` + `requestPersist()` button — user-gesture chain preserved). Diagnostic `storageQuota` + `storageUsed` raw-byte fields added to the W2.6 export payload.
  - **W2.6** (`b8530ec` prep + `15da427` delivery) — V2 export schema = `data` (boot-shim LS only) + `stores` (every IDB store keyed by name) + `media` (JournalMediaStore blobs, base64 via stream-chunked encoder to avoid OOM on >1 MB blobs). V1 export → V2 import: parses pre-W2 LS-JSON strings via per-store `replaceAll`/`setAll`/`set`. V2 export → V1 client: only theme + fontStyle restored (documented limitation). V3+ forward-compat: unknown top-level keys ignored, "newer version" warning shown. 4 `alert()` sites + 3 new sites use `src/utils/toast.js` (consolidated from `jrnShowMilestoneToast`; root-exit-toast left untouched per its pinned inline-opacity test contract). Realistic-volume round-trip verified: 50 annotations + 10 bookmarks + 5 journal-with-media + sample blob bytes equal at multiple offsets after base64 round-trip. 100 MB media guard.
  - **W2.8** (`8ff0774`) — inner `<ErrorBoundary key={screen}>` wrap around `{ROUTES[screen]?.() ?? null}` in app.jsx. The outer boundary at the root createRoot.render still catches anything that escapes; the inner one is the import-path safety net (if a screen crashes from a corrupted-import payload, the chrome stays rendered and the user can navigate away → key changes → boundary remounts).
  - **W2 audit + test sprint (2026-05-27)** — 5-agent sweep of the storage layer surfaced 12 candidate issues. Of these, 4 shipped (the real correctness bugs); 8 polish/defensive items were rejected as out-of-scope. **Shipped:** journal-store.js:412 + journal-index-store.js:136 missing braces — `_bump()` was firing unconditionally on every notebook deletion / entry removal because the `if (changed)` only guarded `_save()`. idb-adapter `del()` gains `tx.onerror` + `tx.onabort`; `getAll()` gains `tx.onabort` — prevents promise hang if a transaction aborts without request-level error propagation (e.g. concurrent versionchange during cursor walk). **Test coverage:** 230 new tests across 8 new test files (bookmark, journal, journal-stats, history, notebook, home-order, journal-media, replace-all) + 17 migrateAnnotations tests appended to annotation-store.test.js. Aggregate coverage 42.24 → 53.57 statements / 32.33 → 43.31 branches / 43.21 → 59.32 functions / 44.84 → 57.70 lines. Vitest gates advanced 42/32/43/44 → 53/43/59/57 per [[lint-regression-gate]]. Per-store coverage now 84-96% on most CachedStore-backed stores. Two non-obvious test-infrastructure gotchas pinned as memory notes: [[journal-stats-subscriber]] and [[jsdom-blob-test-quirks]]. **Tests: 750 → 980 (+230). Bundle-b: 402 KB; bundle-d: 555.6 KB unchanged.**
  - **W2.7a** (LANDED 2026-05-27) — `src/utils/storage-health.js` (~320 lines). Detection engine + assessment module, no UI. Platform detection (android-webview / safari-tab / safari-pwa / firefox / chrome / edge / unknown). 5-tier health assessment (healthy → caution → warning → critical → readonly) from `navigator.storage.estimate()` + `persisted()`. 8 risk flags (safari-7day, ios-pwa-isolate, low-quota, critical-quota, not-persisted, private-mode, write-failed, quota-declining). Write-path integration API: `checkBeforeWrite(bytes)` / `onWriteFailure(err)` / `onWriteSuccess()` / `reassessIfCautious()`. Safari first-data-creation gate (`checkFirstDataCreation()` — sync, fires once per session). Session-level dismissal state. Periodic 5-min refresh with visibility-change resume. `useSyncExternalStore` reactivity contract (subscribe + getVersion). Concurrent `assess()` calls coalesced. Private-browsing heuristic: Safari quota < 120 MB signals likely private mode → CRITICAL tier. Hardened: fallback report (API unavailable) respects `_writeFailedThisSession` → READONLY preserved. 79 vitest tests (95.8% statements / 91.3% branches / 96% functions / 98.8% lines). Wired into bundle-b via `_entry-b.js`. **Bundle-b: 402 → 413 KB (+11 KB).**
  - **W2.7b** (`d0767d3`) — StorageHealthBanner component + 23 tests. 8-scenario priority system (READONLY/writeFailed → privateMode → CRITICAL → WARNING → CAUTION+not-persisted → healthy=nothing). Fixed-position banner z-index 101 above nav. Persist-request flow with granted/denied states. Session-level dismiss via `StorageHealth.dismissScenario`. Key insight: `useSyncExternalStore` snapshot must be `getVersion` (number), not `getReport` (object ref) — dismiss bumps version without replacing report, so `Object.is` comparison on object refs silently fails. `StorageHealth.start()` wired in HydrationGate `.finally()`. **Bundle-d: 555.6 → 560.0 KB (+4.4).**
  - **W2.7c** (`d0767d3`) — Write-path wiring. `CachedStore._save` catch → `StorageHealth.onWriteFailure`. JournalRecordingSheet `startCapture()` pre-flight `checkBeforeWrite(300KB)`. JournalEditorScreen image-insert catch → `onWriteFailure` + toast. SettingsScreen import path intentionally NOT wired (bulk restore should tolerate individual blob failures).
  - **W2.7d** (`d0767d3`) — `useStorageInfo` rewritten to delegate to `StorageHealth.getReport()` via `useSyncExternalStore` (eliminates duplicate `navigator.storage.estimate()` calls). Settings Platform row via `_platformLabel` helper. Tests rewritten to stub StorageHealth instead of navigator.storage. 12 tests.
  - **W2.7e** (`cbdc625`) — Safari7DayModal: fires once per session on first data-creating gesture in Safari tabs (7-day eviction warning). IosPwaWelcomeCard: full-screen welcome on boot when platform=safari-pwa + empty storage (guides import from Safari). Gesture gates: `checkFirstDataCreation()` one-liner in SelectionToolbar (applyHighlight + handleNote + handleBookmark), ChapterBookmarkBtn, useJournalMutations. `safariGateBlocked` field added to StorageHealth report with reactive bump. 17 tests (13 SafariFlows + 4 storage-health). **Bundle-b: 413.0 KB; bundle-d: 566.2 KB (+6.2 from W2.7d baseline).**
  - **W2 polish (2026-05-28)** — 4-tier sweep of the storage layer post-W2.7e. **Tier 1 (bugs):** CachedStore `_save()` catch now always logs IDB write failures (was silent if StorageHealth undefined). `checkBeforeWrite()` correctly blocks when quota is zero (guard split: unknown-API → permissive vs zero-quota → critical). **Tier 2 (UX):** Import reports partial failures via toast counter instead of unconditional success message. Import blocks when any store is degraded (prevents queued-then-discarded writes from the 1500ms reload). `_backgroundRetry` no longer infinite-loops on empty delay array. **Tier 3 (tests):** 71 new tests across 4 files — StateStore (13, lsShim dual-write), RecentNavStore (18, dedup-by-5-tuple + cap-at-30), ProphecyCardsStore (18, falsy-value filtering + defensive copy), AppFlagStores (21, is/set/clear + legacy numeric/string truthies + 3-store independence). **Tier 4 (hardening):** `_purgeAssociated` cascade catch → `console.warn` (was silent). `getAll()` gains `tx.onabort` handler (matches `del()` pattern). `_blobToBase64` chunk size 65536 → 8192 (avoids `String.fromCharCode.apply()` RangeError on engines with <65K argument limit). 4 of 8 original research findings ruled out as false positives after code reading. **Tests: 1099 → 1170 (+71). Coverage: 53.57 → 55.92 statements / 43.31 → 46.34 branches / 59.32 → 60.36 functions / 57.70 → 60.07 lines. Bundle-b: 413.0 → 413.4 KB (+0.4); bundle-d: 566.2 → 566.8 KB (+0.6).**
- **W3 — PWA Shell — LANDED 2026-05-28.** Installable PWA infrastructure. `manifest.json` (standalone display, gold theme, relative start_url/scope). `service-worker.js` with two cache buckets: `vot-core-v{N}` (critical-path assets pre-cached on install, cleared on version bump) + `vot-corpus-c{N}` (corpus bundles bible/matthew/vot **pre-cached on install for full offline** as of v1.0.1; cached on first fetch as fallback; stable across versions). No `skipWaiting` — update lifecycle uses `controllerchange` → in-app toast ("New version available — tap to update") so user controls reload timing. `offline.html` dark-themed fallback page with "Try again" button. PWA icons at 512/192/180/32/16px resized from existing 1024x1024 `ic_launcher_foreground.png`. SW registration gated behind `PlatformBridge.isAndroid` (added as exported boolean property) — Android WebView never registers the SW (assets already bundled in APK; SW would double-cache and create stale-content conflicts). Registration wired in `_entry-b.js` at app startup. index.html gains `<link rel="manifest">`, `<meta name="theme-color">`, `<meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-capable">`, Apple touch icon, and favicon links. **Bundle-b: 413.2 → 414.1 KB (+0.9 KB). Tests: 1182 → 1236 (+54 from W9.1). Committed `54a8c49`.** SW-not-registered-on-Android verification still needs device/emulator (W6); desktop Chrome "Install" prompt is now testable on the W5 GitHub Pages deploy.
- **W9.1 — Format A schema validator — LANDED 2026-05-28.** `tools/validate-schemas.js` exports `validateFormatA(letters, opts)` returning `{ errors[], warnings[] }`. Validates required fields, 7 block types (para/poetry/closing/closing-fn/note/scripture/intro), 7 segment types, footnote integrity (type + ref cross-check against nkjv dict), bidirectional fn-segment/footnote cross-reference, nkjv orphan detection, and prev/nextLetter chain consistency. CLI runner loads all 11 Format A data files via `vm.runInNewContext`. **354 letters validated, 0 errors, 2 warnings** (both legitimate orphaned note-type footnotes in volume-one + letters-timothy). Schema adjusted during development: added `intro` block type (found in volume-two.js). npm script: `"validate:data"`. 54 vitest tests in `tools/validate-schemas.test.js`. Committed `84e4642`. **Continuation (B/C/D + Holy Days) landed 2026-05-29 — see next bullet. Remaining:** import payload validation (W9.3).
- **W9.1 continuation — Format B/C/D + Holy Days validators — LANDED 2026-05-29.** `validateFormatB` (WTLB One/Two + The Blessed: id/title/paragraphs, `align ∈ center|justify|left`, inline `{{nav:bookId:chapter}}` syntax = error + `{{ref:…}}` existence vs the module-level scriptures dict = warning). `validateHolyDays` — the album is **HYBRID**: each entry dispatches to the Format A or Format B per-item validator on `entry.type` (`"letter"`/`"wtlb"`); reuses `validateFormatA`/`validateFormatB` via single-element arrays so no rule duplication; validates its own `prevEntry`/`nextEntry` chain. `validateFormatC` (books.js object-of-books + matthew-plain single book + books-restored chrome via `chromeOnly` opt; chapters→sections→verses; verse numbering ascending = error, gap = warning). `validateFormatD` (bible-studies: studies→parts→`chapterIds` resolved against `study.chapters[].id`; `parts` optional — only study 1 is multi-part). Generalized the Format A chain block into a shared `validateChain(items, …, prevKey, nextKey, noun)` (Format A messages preserved via `noun='letter'`; the 54 Format A tests stay green). CLI validates all formats in ~0.3s: **869 items, 0 errors.** **Deferred to a future Format-E pass** (distinct shapes postdating this spec): `matthew.js` Study Bible (preface + sectionless annotated chapters), `matthew-nkjv.js` (ref→text dict), `bible-*.js` (7 translation verse maps). **FINDING — the validator's first real catch:** books.js is missing **Hebrews 10:15-18, 11:12-31, 13:18-19** (26 verses, incl. 20 of the faith chapter) — invisible to `check_balance.py`; surfaced as verse-gap warnings (gaps stay warnings since single-verse omissions can be legit critical-text variants). Needs a data-sourcing fix from a trusted NKJV — do NOT fabricate. **Tests 1267 → 1319** (+52 in `validate-schemas.test.js`; tools/ is outside the coverage-measured scope).
- **W9.3 — Import payload validation — LANDED 2026-05-29 → W9 COMPLETE.** New `src/utils/import-validators.js` (coverage-measured): `validateStorePayload(name, payload)` checks the top-level shape of all 14 IDB store payloads (object-of-arrays / object-of-objects / listObject / array / stringArray / plain-object) — deliberately shallow (top-level + container field, no per-record sweep); `validateImportEnvelope` (app / exportVersion / data / stores / media); `validateMediaRecord` (base64-head + approx-size guard, injectable limit for tests). Wired into `SettingsScreen._doImport`: envelope gate up front, then BOTH the V2 and V1 store loops validate each payload and **SKIP** invalid sections — so a corrupt section can't overwrite good data, and the two non-coercing stores (`StateStore` + `HomeOrderStore`, which would otherwise persist garbage as-is) are protected; media records validated before `JournalMediaStore.put`; the completion toast reports skipped sections. Globalized via `_entry-b.js` (387 → 390 eslint globals); **runtime-verified in preview** (all 3 are live `function` globals; reject array-for-object, non-string entries, bad envelope, bad base64; tolerate unknown stores). 37 vitest cases. **Coverage floor ratcheted 55/46/60/60 → 58/48/62/62.** Tests 1319 → 1356.
- **W9.2 — Validator wired into pre-commit + CI — LANDED 2026-05-28 (`847923d`).** Pre-commit Step 1's data-file block now runs `node tools/validate-schemas.js --strict` after `check_balance.py` (node-on-PATH probe mirrors the bundle-rebuild step). CI gains a "Validate data schemas" step right after Lint (fails fast before typecheck/test/build). Gate proven to block via break-and-revert: an emptied letter title produced FAIL + exit 1.
- **W5 — GitHub Pages hosting + dual CI + version sync — LANDED 2026-05-28 (`021e94a`).** The PWA deploys as static files. **W5.1** `.github/workflows/deploy-web.yml` builds bundles, rsync-stages the web-facing `app/src/main/assets` subtree (excludes `src/`, `*.d.ts`, `*.lnk` — dist/ bundles hold all runtime code) and publishes via the official GitHub Pages actions on push-to-main + manual dispatch. Target: `https://VOTReader.github.io/VOTReader-studio/`. No base-path rewriting needed — every in-app path is relative and SW/manifest use `./` scope; the app never changes the URL path (`history.pushState({}, '', '')`), so no SPA 404 fallback. **W5.2** CSP simplified to `'self'`-only (dropped explicit `appassets.androidplatform.net`; `'self'` resolves to the serving origin on BOTH the Android WebViewAssetLoader and GitHub Pages). Preview-verified: app renders, 0 console errors, 0 CSP violations. **W5.3** the existing ci.yml `build` job already does web-build verification; its bundle-match step now also covers `service-worker.js`. **W5.4** SW `CACHE_VERSION` is content-hash-derived — `tools/sync-sw-version.js` (`build:sw`) sets `v{package.version}-{sha256 of CORE_ASSETS, CRLF-normalized}`, so the core cache **auto-busts on any core-asset change with no manual bump**. Pre-commit re-versions + re-stages `service-worker.js` when a bundle / `app.css` / `index.html` changes; CI's verify gate confirms it matches cross-platform. `CORPUS_VERSION` stays manual — a corpus DATA change is a ~10 MB re-download per client, so it should be deliberate. **LIVE + verified 2026-05-28** at `https://votreader.github.io/VOTReader-studio/`: repo made public + account renamed corbinlythgoe→VOTReader; Pages enabled via `gh api -X POST repos/VOTReader/VOTReader-studio/pages -f build_type=workflow` (the workflow's `configure-pages` auto-enable did NOT take on first run — one-time manual/gh enablement required). Deploy succeeded; all assets serve 200; PWA installs in Chrome (passed installability); SW pre-caches the full corpus for offline (v1.0.1). **Remaining:** SW update-cycle + real-device checks (W6).
- **Font toggle — Classic / Modern (LANDED 2026-05-27, post-W1, pre-W2).** W0.1 fixed @font-face pointing to nonexistent files — fonts were silently falling back to system serif for the entire life of the app. Fixing the bug introduced a readability regression: EB Garamond has ~15-20% smaller x-height than system serif at the same CSS size, and Cinzel at small chrome sizes (0.78rem dates, etc.) is spindly. Solution: settings toggle, default Classic (system serif — what everyone's been reading for years), opt-in Modern (Cinzel + EB Garamond). Implementation is clever — instead of replacing 260 hardcoded `font-family: 'Cinzel', serif` declarations in app.css, the `<style id="custom-fonts">` block in index.html is toggled via `.disabled`. When disabled, browser's built-in font fallback resolves every reference to `serif` automatically. Zero CSS rule changes. Boot script (line 66 in index.html) handles initial state pre-React-mount (no FOUC); use-settings.js effect handles live toggle without reload. Setting persists in `vot-state.settings.fontStyle` ("classic" | "modern"). Bumped EB Garamond weight range from `400 500` to `400 800` so real bold renders in Modern (no more synthetic bold). Future widely-adjustable system (multiple fonts, sizes, per-element scope) documented in PLAN.txt "FONT TOGGLE" section — when it lands, it migrates the 260 hardcoded refs to CSS vars and grows the toggle into a font/size selector.
- **W0-W10 cross-platform PWA + quality hardening plan** — Phases: W0 prereqs ✅ → W1 PlatformBridge ✅ → W2 IndexedDB ✅ → **W3 PWA shell ✅** → **W4 desktop polish ✅** → **W5 hosting (GitHub Pages) + dual CI ✅** → W6 cross-platform verification (deferred — needs a physical device) → **W7 quality hardening ✅** → **W8 type coverage ✅ (W8.1 UI typing + W8.3 scripture types done; W8.2 @layer RETIRED)** → W9 data integrity ✅ (Format A/B/C/D + Holy Days validators + W9.2 gate wiring + W9.3 import payload validation) → W10 accessibility. Full per-phase exit criteria + traceability matrix in PLAN.txt. (W7 landed before W6 because W6 needs real hardware; W7 was device-independent.)
- **Delete-confirm standardization — 5 commits (2026-05-26).** New `ConfirmStrip` primitive at `app/src/main/assets/src/ui/components/ConfirmStrip.jsx` (36 lines + 10 vitest cases) wraps the existing `.ann-chip-confirm` CSS family with a `{ question, yesLabel = 'Yes, delete', onCancel, onConfirm, className, style }` API. Replaces every bespoke delete affordance in the app. **Bucket A** (`42f9eb3`) — 11 mechanical markup swaps: NoteSheet, NotebookManagerSheet, NotebookPickerSheet, JournalNotebookSheet, BookmarkCreateSheet, BookmarksScreen (RowActionSheet + BookmarkPopover), LinksScreen LinkRowActionSheet, NotesIndexScreen drilled-in, LinkCard, AnnotationActionChip. Redundant `padding: 10px 12px` inline styles dropped (base CSS already supplies). **Bucket C** (`cc22558`) — 4 multi-stage patterns collapsed to 1-step. ClearProgressRow + SettingsScreen: drops `clearPending`/`getStage`/`handleClearTap`/`resetClearPending` machinery + adds 3 per-row helper components (HistoryClearRow, SectionClearBtn, AllProgressClearRow) at module scope so each owns internal confirm state. Tabs Overview "Clear All Tabs": drops `clearAllStage`/`setClearAllStage` through useTabActions/AppShellOverlays/app.jsx + the App-level reset effect on overview close; state internal to TabsOverview. JournalEditor block delete: drops `confirmDelStep` 2-step + `requestDeleteBlock`/`cancelDeleteBlock` helpers; banner positioning preserved via `className="jrn-block-confirm"`. HistoryScreen Deduplicate: drops 5-second auto-cancel timer + `pendingBtnRef` + click-outside effect. **Bucket B** (`d0ebf35`) — only behavior change: SelectionToolbar ✕ Remove highlight was instant; now collapses the whole toolbar to a ConfirmStrip ("Remove this highlight?" / "Yes, remove"). Internal state resets on every selInfo change so a fresh selection never inherits mid-confirm state. **JournalAudioBlock** (`5848f0d`) — banner-style ConfirmStrip replaces play+waveform+meta when confirming; the `<audio>` element below the conditional stays rendered so playback state (currentTime, paused/playing) survives a Cancel. **Type-DELETE survivors (intentional):** journal entry delete (JournalHubScreen + JournalViewerScreen) + Settings "Clear All Personal Data" — both keep the type-DELETE-to-confirm modal. **Per-tab × close in TabsOverview stays instant** (browser-like). Cleanup along the way: `CLEAR_LABELS` / `CLEAR_CLASSES` dropped from index.html (no caller); `.history-dedupe-btn.is-pending` dropped from app.css; `.jrn-block-confirm-{cancel,yes,q,step2}` + `.jrn-aud-delete-{confirm,q,cancel,yes}` dropped from journal-styles.js (replaced by the standardized `.ann-chip-confirm-*` family).
- **Post-NK polish — 5 follow-up commits (2026-05-26).** Driven by a 96/100 architectural review that named the genuine remaining gaps. **JsEvent sealed class** (`3b7daa8`) — typed registry replaces all 8 raw `"__onFoo"` strings in `bridge.callOptional` call sites; `JsBridge.callOptional(event: JsEvent, ...)` overload delegates to the string version (defense-in-depth with the existing FN_NAME regex guard). **Haptic feedback bridge** (`f9234df`) — `@JavascriptInterface haptic(style: Int)` exposes 4 vibration styles (tick/click/heavy/double) using `VibrationEffect.createPredefined` on API 29+ with `createOneShot` fallback for API 26-28; VIBRATE permission added. JS-side wire-up (which taps fire haptics) is owed. **JVM target bump 11 → 17** (`fa4d660`) — aligns bytecode with the AGP 9.x build toolchain; zero behavior change in a pure-Kotlin project. **AppInterface extraction behind BridgeHost** (`639de65`) — the 20 @JavascriptInterface methods move to their own top-level `AppInterface.kt` (305 lines), constructor-injected with `BridgeHost` (Activity-surface abstraction) + `JsBridge` + `MainViewModel`. MainActivity 937 → 773 lines (−164); zero behavior change. **AppInterface tests** (`91907f7`) — 27 new tests via `FakeBridgeHost` (plain class implementing BridgeHost with mutable fields). Zero of the 27 need an Activity, Robolectric, or real WebView — the structural payoff of the extraction. `BridgeHost.hasAudioPermission()` added so the requestMicPermission flow tests cleanly without static `ContextCompat.checkSelfPermission`. **Kotlin tests: 104 → 134** across 6 → 7 files.
- **Phase NK — Kotlin Native Quality CLOSED.** 9 commits bring the Kotlin tree to the same JS-side quality bar (Q3-Q8). New stack: JUnit 5 Jupiter + junit-vintage (Robolectric's JUnit 4 bridge) + kotlin-test-junit5 + Robolectric 4.14.1 + MockK 1.13.13 + androidx.test.core/ext.junit + JaCoCo 0.8.12. **104 Kotlin unit tests across 6 files** (SmokeTest 2 + JsBridgeTest 28 + StorageManagerTest 24 + NativeAudioRecorderTest 12 + MainViewModelTest 9 + BoundedLogTreeTest 29). **JaCoCo coverage gate at 0.85 line-coverage floor** on JsBridge + BoundedLogTree (current achieved 0.87 — JsBridge 27/39 + BoundedLogTree 58/58). Pre-commit Step 6 now runs `:app:testDebugUnitTest :app:jacocoTestCoverageVerification`; CI has a new `kotlin-tests` job on JDK 21 with HTML report upload on failure. **JsBridge hardening:** `require(fn.matches(\w+))` injection guard on `callOptional` + new `U+0000` JS-source escape branch in `quote()`. **Release-build logging:** `BoundedLogTree.kt` planted on release builds (ring buffer of last 200 WARN+ entries with content URI + abs-path sanitization), surfaced via a new `AndroidBridge.getCrashLog()` @JavascriptInterface and folded into the Settings → Your Data → Export JSON as a `diagnosticLog` field. Settings shows the entry count + last-error timestamp in a new row that's hidden on debug builds / web preview. Real-device verification of the full N1.x + NK5 happy paths is owed against an actual phone — see `tools/n1-smoke-walk.md` (NK7, 287-line numbered checklist).
- **Phase N1 — Native-side polish CLOSED.** 13 commits (10 N1.x + 3 post-review hardening) bring `MainActivity.kt` to the same quality bar as the JS side. New files: `VOTReaderApp.kt` (Application subclass for Timber), `JsBridge.kt` (centralized evaluateJavascript), `MainViewModel.kt` (config-change-surviving state), `NativeAudioRecorder.kt` (MediaRecorder lifecycle), `StorageManager.kt` (file I/O). `MainActivity.kt`: 869 → 937 lines on net (Timber + onRenderProcessGone + JsBridge + N1.8 callback + import-size guard added; recorder + file I/O extracted out). 14 raw `Log.w("VOTReader", …)` calls → Timber; every `evaluateJavascript` site routes through `JsBridge` (one documented N1.8 60Hz-loop exception). PixelCopy + coroutines on screenshot path; renderer-crash recovery with crash-loop guard; per-frame IME tracking via `WindowInsetsAnimationCompat`. New deps: timber 5.0.1, kotlinx-coroutines-android 1.10.2, lifecycle-runtime-ktx 2.9.1, lifecycle-viewmodel-ktx 2.9.1.
- **JSX conversion COMPLETE** (Q2.7-2, `b233cc3`). Every React component is JSX.
- **App() lives in `app/src/main/assets/src/app.jsx`** (Q2.7-1, `c1e3da1`). **770 lines — Phase 1 + Phase 2 CLOSED; P11 re-decomp.** 28 hooks (15 P6 + 11 P7a-k + 2 P11: useDomAnnotationSync + useKeyboardInset). The ≤800 budget is now enforced by a canary gate (`npm run check:app-size`, in pre-commit + CI) after it silently drifted 797→838 post-Phase-2. **All 53 screens dispatch from a single ROUTES table** that lives in its own file (`src/ui/screen-routes.jsx`) via a `buildScreenRoutes(deps)` factory. The 3 substantive inline blocks (matthew-ch, bible-study-chapter, holy-days-index playlist header) extracted to their own screen/component files. Welcome modal + tabs overview + disable-tabs prompt + garden warning live in `AppShellOverlays`; 12 annotation/link/journal/bookmark sheets live in `AppShellSheets`. App() now owns composition, not implementation.
- **Q6 CSS hardening CLOSED.** app.css 4,410 → 4,125 (−285 dead). 93 raw-hex usages consolidated to vars (`--hl-{yellow|green|pink|...}` palette + `--danger` + `--settings-warning/danger` + `--input-text` + `--white`). `!important` count 36 → 25 (Cat A removed; B-F load-bearing).
- **Q7 useSyncExternalStore migration CLOSED.** 23 of 24 Bin 4 `hlTick` cache-bust eslint-disables removed (24th is in `annotation-store.test.js` documenting the old pattern). 7 stores now expose `subscribe / getVersion / _bump`; 14 consumers migrated. **hlTick prop threading fully removed (2026-05-28):** all `setHlTick(t => t + 1)` calls in 29 components now route through `window.__bumpHlTick()` bridge; hlTick state + effects stay in App.jsx. Net −105 lines, bundle-d −1.0 KB.
- **Q8 lazy-load COMPLETE.** All corpus files lazy-loaded. Critical-path bundle: 11.7 MB → 1.03 MB (**91% reduction**). Q8.1 books.js → `bundle-a-bible.js` (6.9 MB), Q8.2 matthew.js → `bundle-a-matthew.js` (618 KB), Q8.3 all VOT corpora → `bundle-a-vot.js` (3 MB). Loaders pre-fire from the appropriate landing screens (Home / ScripturesHome / StudiesHome / VolumesHome); ROUTES entries show "Loading…" placeholder if user lands directly on a content screen pre-load.
- **135+ modules** under `app/src/main/assets/src/` — every screen, sheet, component, store, hook, utility, renderer helper is an ES module.
- **7 cluster bundles** in `app/src/main/assets/dist/`:
  - `bundle-a.js` 1.03 MB — vendor + small data (matthew-plain/nkjv, books-restored) + search engine (critical path)
  - `bundle-a-bible.js` 6.9 MB — books.js (NKJV) lazy-loaded via `window.__loadBibleCorpus()`
  - `bundle-a-matthew.js` 618 KB — matthew.js (Study Bible) lazy-loaded via `window.__loadMatthewCorpus()`
  - `bundle-a-vot.js` 3 MB — 14 VOT corpora (volumes/letters/WTLB/holy days/hidden manna) lazy-loaded via `window.__loadVotCorpus()`
  - `bundle-b.js` 431.6 KB — stores + components + hooks + journal + scripture-resolution + letter-linking + W1.5 modal registry + history-sync + W1 platform-bridge + W2.7 StorageHealth + W3 SW registration + W7.4 DiagnosticLog (esbuild IIFE)
  - `bundle-c.js` 27 KB — renderer (esbuild IIFE, 3 files)
  - `bundle-d.js` 565.8 KB — screens + sheets + components + utils + late stores + screen-routes + App() + W1.5 AppShell registrations + W2.7 StorageHealthBanner + SafariFlows (esbuild IIFE)
- **1248 vitest tests** across 48 files.

### Q3 ESLint — CLOSED 2026-05-24

- **0 errors / 0 warnings.** Baseline 154/216 → 0/0. CI `--max-warnings 0` locked at `d955e98`; any new warning fails CI. The 55 `eslint-disable-next-line` cites across 31 files were audited at phase close (each cite's named identifiers verified to be read in the corresponding effect body).
- **Pre-commit lint via lint-staged** (`a545d81`): sub-second per-file lint at the commit prompt; same `--max-warnings 0` policy as CI.
- **Bin classification framework** (durable reference for Q4/Q5/Q6 disable cites):
  - Bin 1 — add the dep (eslint's recommended fix; safe for stable setters/callbacks)
  - Bin 2 — disable + ref-mirror / closure-stable cite (useRefMirror, local helpers reading already-tracked closure values)
  - Bin 3 — disable + mount-only or setter-stability cite (`[]`-deps intent; useState setters passed through hook returns)
  - Bin 4 — disable + cache-bust / identity-churn cite (hlTick bump signal, commitDwellNow per-render rebinding)

### Q4 — JSDoc / `tsc --checkJs` (CLOSED 2026-05-24)

37 files typed across utils (11) + stores (11) + hooks (15). App() and the ui/ tree intentionally deferred — that's the App() decomposition phase. See HISTORY.md for the per-commit breakdown.

- **Infrastructure** (`001747b`): `tsconfig.json` `checkJs: true` + `strict: false`; include narrowed to utils/stores/hooks; `_entry-b.js` excluded. `@types/react` + `@types/react-dom` installed. `tools/gen-eslint-globals.py` extended to emit a parallel `tools/globals.generated.d.ts` (331 `declare const X: any;` + Window index signature — cross-bundle is untyped by design). `CachedStoreBase<T>` typedef as the store-layer type root.
- **Pattern** (`b349b02`): `extendStore(base, methods)` helper wraps `Object.assign` with `ThisType<B & M>` so `this` inside store-method literals resolves to BOTH the CachedStore base AND the sibling methods. Lifts every `@ts-nocheck` cleanly.
- **Bundle-b grew** 302→320 KB from JSDoc comments preserved in dev build (esbuild strips comments in minified prod build).
- **Gates live:** `npm run typecheck` runs in CI between lint and build AND in pre-commit Step 3. Zero-tolerance from day one (per [[lint-regression-gate]]); any type error fails the commit.

### Post-Q4 — Q5 safety-net phase CLOSED, App() decomposition CLOSED

**Pinned sequence** (PLAN.txt + [[refactor-after-tests]]): smoke-lite ✅ → Q5 vitest ✅ → **App() decomposition (CLOSED 2026-05-25 with Phase 2)**.

**Q5 safety-net phase totals (2026-05-24):**
- **218 tests across 9 files**; 9 of 37 Q4-scope files have direct coverage.
- Coverage ratchet over the phase: statements **1→14**, branches **2→11**, functions **0.4→12**, lines **0.9→15**.
- **Pre-commit gates** (run on src changes, ~5-6s): check_balance → lint-staged → typecheck → vitest → build. CI adds smoke-lite + the gated `test:coverage` variant.

**Q5 commit chain:**
- Infrastructure: smoke-lite (`102b883`), Q5.1 (`742f657`).
- First real test + gate lock: Q5.2 _validateTabState (`a69b739`, 86 tests, 13-rule coverage table).
- Suppress validation: Q5.3 hlTick cache-bust (`ee073f9`) — empirically proved the 24 Bin 4 suppresses guard real refresh behavior (test B asserts stale reads without hlTick in deps).
- Silent-corruption guards: Q5.4 LinkStore migration (`a5fce71`), Q5.5 JournalIndexStore cascade (`02eca54`), Q5.6 useSavedState round-trip (`f3a56c4`), Q5.7 NoteStore cascade (`a3466c1`), Q5.8 useHistory gate (`a9e43c2`), Q5.9 scripture-parse (`41b19ba`).

**Plateau signal recognized** ([[tests-diminishing-returns]]): pre-scripture-parse deltas were +1 per commit on average; the remaining un-tested Q4 surfaces (small utility helpers like book-category, hl-keys, search, tabs, dates, garden) are lower-leverage than App() decomposition. **The safety net is built; time to use it.**

### P7 — App() decomposition (IN PROGRESS, 2026-05-24)

**Goal:** App.jsx under 800 lines. Currently **2,254** (was 2,261 before P7a, 2,256 before P7b).

**Structural measurement (post-P7a):** App() body is lines 24–2253.
- **Logic block:** lines 24–1151 (**1,128 lines** — hooks + callbacks + effects + nav-helper glue).
- **JSX render tree:** lines 1152–2253 (**1,103 lines** — 55 conditional `{screen === "X" && ...}` blocks).

The 50/50 split means **hook extraction alone cannot hit <800.** The render tree by itself is 1,103 lines — that's the floor for any logic-only extraction. PLAN.txt §1 has the two-phase plan and Phase 2's risk profile (CSS selectors, layout shifts, ErrorBoundary placement — render decomposition needs visual smoke walks, not just vitest).

**Phase 1 — logic extraction CLOSED (2026-05-25).** Goal hit: **zero inline concerns remaining in App()'s logic block**, all extracted to 11 hooks under src/hooks/. Per [[concerns-not-lines]] the metric was concerns-not-lines; App.jsx still has 1,846 lines (1,103 of which are the JSX render tree — Phase 2's target). The 11 P7 hooks: useNavHistoryTracking + useNav + useSearch + useBibleStudies + useJournalMutations + useTapThrough + useReadProgress + useReadingPositionNav + useReadingChainNav + useSurprise + useAppShellEffects. 465 vitest tests; coverage broke 30% lines. P7k closing commit landed all four AppShell concerns (`__bumpHlTick` bridge + welcome modal + isOnline ping + dismissWelcome routing).
- **P7a (LANDED 2026-05-24, `d89775f`)** — useNavHistoryTracking. 18-line useEffect → 115-line hook + 23 vitest tests. The 4-helper disable cite (most architecturally-debted post-Q3 disable in the file, with the extraction candidate named in its own text) moved with the effect. TDZ note: call site lives below `getStudyById`/`getStudyChapter`, mirroring P6l's useAndroidBack. Tests 218→241, branches gate bumped 11→13.
- **P7b (LANDED 2026-05-24, `ee6339e`)** — useNav. 20 simple nav-chrome helpers extracted (4 simple switchers + 8 navOrigin-pattern + 2 journal-nav + 5 trivial switchers + goScriptureGenre). 8 duplicated `setNavOrigin({...})` literals dedupe to one private `_captureOrigin()`. 34 new vitest tests; tests 241→275; statements gate 14→17, functions 12→16, lines 15→17.
- **P7c (LANDED 2026-05-24)** — useSearch. Full search domain extracted: 4 search tabFields (searchOrigin/searchScope/searchContext/searchQuery), searchOriginRef, srchVolLookup/SRCH_VOL_MAP/srchResolveLetterId helpers, goSearch (26-line context computation), goSearchOrigin, handleSearchSelect (80-line dispatcher), handleSearchCommand, window.__goSearch bridge effect. **Per the dissolution principle ([[dont-group-by-shape]]):** the search-domain handlers (handleSearchSelect, handleSearchCommand, srch*) landed in useSearch where they belong, NOT in a "useHandlers" junk drawer. App.jsx dropped 134 lines (largest single P7 extraction so far — handleSearchSelect alone was 80 lines). 56 new vitest tests covering all 14 handleSearchSelect branches + 7 handleSearchCommand actions + 4 goSearch context variants + the window.__goSearch identity-churn invariant. Tests 275→331; all 4 gates ratchet: statements 17→21, branches 13→18, functions 16→18, lines 17→22. TDZ note: useSearch's call site sits BETWEEN handleSurprise (above) and useAndroidBack (below) by necessity — handleSurprise is a useSearch param (cross-domain 'random' handoff) and useAndroidBack consumes goSearchOrigin from useSearch's return. Caught the wrong initial placement in smoke verification (TDZ ReferenceError); fix was a single move-block edit.
- **P7h+i pair (LANDED 2026-05-24)** — the reading-navigation pair.
  - **P7h — useReadingPositionNav**: setLastReadForVol + selectMatthewCh/BibleCh + goToLastRead + prophecyCardStatesRef + saveProphecyCardStates. ~50 lines moved. 22 tests. Call site sits BETWEEN useBibleStudies and useTapThrough (downstream of getStudyById/selectStudy from useBibleStudies). Sequencing change: useBibleStudies moved UP from its P7d placement to right after useReadingDwell, spending the TDZ dividend for the first time.
  - **P7i — useReadingChainNav**: the cross-volume chain (Revelation → V1 → ... → Garden) + within-Bible book prev/next. boundaryConfig + _first/_last/_firstPreface + _goFirst/_goLast maps + bookIdx/prev/nextBibleBook + goNext/PrevBibleBook + chIsFirst/Last + bcv* boundary render props + goToRevelationLast. ~110 lines moved. 28 tests (boundary branch dispatch + chain-walk skipping empties + the load-bearing Revelation→Volume-One bridge + null-guards). The hook EXPOSES the full computed surface (boundaryConfig + bcv* + 8 helpers) but App() destructures only what it consumes — clean contract for future render-tree consumers without a surface change.
  - Tests 402 → 452 (+50). Coverage gates jump biggest yet: statements 25→29, branches 21→24, functions 24→27, lines 26→30 (broke 30%).
  - App() 1,987 → **1,890** (−97). P7i alone shaved 86 lines.
- **P7e+f+g batch (LANDED 2026-05-24)** — 3 small extractions in one session, demonstrating the TDZ dividend (every extraction post-P7d is independent, so small ones can batch).
  - **P7e — useJournalMutations**: createAndEditJournal (1 fn). 8 tests.
  - **P7f — useTapThrough**: goToLetterFromMatthew + openInAppLetter (~72 lines, push onto fromLetterStack + set destination). 13 tests.
  - **P7g — useReadProgress**: added to useMarkAsRead.js as second export. Owns readItems state + VERSION_ID + getReadKey + isRead/markRead/unmarkRead + clearAllProgress + clearReadForBook (folded in from inline `onClearBook` arrow → VERSION_ID stays internal). 17 tests.
  - Smoke caught TWO TDZ errors in useTapThrough's params (setFromMatthewCh then setActiveReadKey); both resolved by moving the call site below useReadingDwell + hoisting the fromMatthewCh tabField. Same kind of issue the TDZ-blocker dividend was supposed to eliminate, but for setters not study helpers — the dividend is real for getStudyById/getStudyChapter but each new extraction still needs its own dep check.
  - Tests 364 → 402 (+38). All 4 gates ratchet: statements 23→25, branches 19→21, functions 21→24, lines 24→26.
  - App() 2,056 → **1,987** (broke 2,000). Net −69 across the 3 commits.
- **P7d (LANDED 2026-05-24)** — useBibleStudies. **The TDZ-blocker.** STUDIES + UNIFIED_CHAIN data + getStudyById/getStudyChapter/studyReadKey lookups + selectStudy (smart single-vs-multi router) + selectStudyChapter + prevChainEntry/nextChainEntry + goToChainEntryFirst/Last (with the matthew-study special-case for the Matthew Study Bible's bible-ch renderer). **Structural win:** call site moved HIGH UP (right after useNav), demonstrating that the TDZ blocker is gone — getStudyById/getStudyChapter are now hook returns instead of const arrows, so downstream hooks (useAndroidBack/useNavHistoryTracking/useSearch) are no longer forced to live below the Bible Studies block. (They haven't moved yet — that's a separate refactor; the freedom is the dividend that future extractions can spend.) 33 new vitest tests covering lookups + selectStudy's 3 routing branches (single/singlePage/multi) + UNIFIED_CHAIN composition (8 entries: 6 studies + Matthew, with locked/empty filtered) + chain prev/next boundaries + goToChainEntryFirst/Last for both Matthew + regular study branches. App() shrank 64 lines. Tests 331 → 364. Coverage ratchet: statements 21→23, branches 18→19, functions 18→21, lines 22→24. **Caught the `*/`-in-comment bug for the second time** (P7b had it too); captured as memory [[no-comment-terminator-in-text]] so the next session won't repeat.
- **Next**: useReadingChainNav (boundary nav + bible book prev/next), useMarkAsRead-helpers, useReadingPositionNav, useTapThrough, useJournalMutations, useSurprise (handler dissolution), useAppShellEffects.

### Phase 2 — render-tree decomposition (CLOSED 2026-05-25)

**Goal:** App.jsx under 800 lines. **Hit: 1,815 → 797 lines.**

7 commits land the render-tree extraction:
- **P9a** (`084b2fb`) — bible-study-chapter (88 lines → 30) → `BibleStudyChapterView.jsx`. The largest substantive ROUTES entry: letterShim builder + jumpToStudy/handleLetterClick + LetterView.
- **P9b** (`92ec3c2`) — matthew-ch (43 → 19) → `MatthewChapterView.jsx`. Chain-aware boundary logic + ChapterView + ModeToggle.
- **P9c** (`2b41f49`) — holy-days-index playlist conditional (31 → 6) → `HolyDaysPlaylistHeader.jsx`.
- **P9d** (`4d38384`) — AppShellOverlays (137 lines moved). Welcome modal + tabs overview + TabActionSheet + disable-tabs prompt + garden warning, all in one shell component.
- **P9e** (`40f76ce`) — AppShellSheets (186 lines moved). 12 annotation/link/journal/bookmark sheets and popovers.
- **P9f** (`3eae5b4`) — `buildScreenRoutes` factory in `src/ui/screen-routes.jsx`. 560-line ROUTES table moves out; App() destructures ~90 closure deps into one explicit prop bundle (`props are explicit, not spread`). App.jsx: 1,412 → 888.
- **P9g** (`5e1fda5`) — 5 prop-builder helpers (colIdxProps / colReadNavProps / _idxNav / sharedViewProps / _navToChapter) move INTO buildScreenRoutes (they're only used by ROUTES entries). Legacy single-line `/* X → src/hooks/Y */` breadcrumbs pruned per [[doc_pruning]]. App.jsx: 888 → 797.

**Exit criteria — ALL HOLD:**
- ✅ Every ROUTES entry with >20 lines of inline JSX extracted to its own component file
- ✅ ROUTES itself lives in `src/ui/screen-routes.jsx`
- ✅ Overlay UI extracted to `AppShellOverlays`
- ✅ Sheet/popover layer extracted to `AppShellSheets`
- ✅ App() under 800 lines (797)
- ✅ All 5 pre-commit gates pass (check_balance + lint + typecheck + vitest 465 tests + build)
- ✅ Visual smoke walk completed for every extracted screen

### Q6 — CSS hardening (CLOSED 2026-05-25)

Mechanical execution against the 772-line `css-audit.txt`. app.css:
**4,410 → 4,125 lines (−285, ~6.5%)**.

- **Q6.1-Q6.5** — dead-rule sweeps (285 lines deleted across 5 commits):
  BOOK SELECTOR block (62), old HOME-card (20), LETTER LIST (38), old
  SEARCH v1 + srch facet/chip (48), notes-sort-menu + hl-remove-menu +
  scattered (117). Each verified zero-references via word-boundary
  grep + visual smoke walk.
- **Q6.6** — 10-color annotation palette → `--hl-*` CSS vars. 62 raw
  hex usages collapse to 10 var definitions in `:root`. Plus the
  intentional `.navpick-row-icon-bible-chapter` brown alias.
- **Q6.7** — Six more multi-use hex values consolidated: `--danger`
  (10 → 9 uses after Q6.5 deleted one), `--settings-warning`,
  `--settings-danger`, `--input-text` (with light-mode override),
  `--white`. 31 raw hex literals replaced with vars.
- **Q6.8** — Category A `!important` (11 decls): empirically removed.
  The audit's "shorthand expansion" reasoning didn't match: base
  `.hl-note.is-active` uses LONGHANDS (no implicit currentColor), and
  per-color rule's 3-class specificity beats the 2-class base. Probed
  via `document.styleSheets` live patch + computed-style check across
  all 11 colors, dark + light mode.
- **Q6.9** — Categories B/C/D/E/F (25 decls): KEPT. The light-mode
  palette specificity argument (`body.light .hl-yellow` = 0,0,2,1
  exceeds `.hl-note:not(.is-active)` = 0,0,2,0) is genuinely
  load-bearing for the palette-strip guards. `:where()` / `@layer`
  cleanup is a redesign, deferred.

`!important` count: 36 → 25.

### Q7 — useSyncExternalStore migration (CLOSED 2026-05-25)

23 of 24 Bin 4 `eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps`
cites removed; the canonical `hlTick` cache-bust pattern replaced with
per-store React 18 reactivity. The 24th lives in `annotation-store.test.js`
and documents the OLD pattern with proof it was justified BEFORE
migration — kept as a historical regression marker.

- **Q7.1** — CachedStore base: added `subscribe(cb) → unsubscribe`,
  `getVersion()`, `_bump()`, `_version`, `_listeners`. Every store
  inherits via `extendStore()`. 9 new cases in `cached-store.test.js`
  prove the contract (notification, unsubscribe, idempotence, throwing
  subscriber doesn't block siblings, etc.).
- **Q7.2** — AnnotationStore + NoteStore migrations. 3 consumers
  migrated (HighlightableText, NoteSheet × 2). Q5.3 test extended
  with tests E + F (useSyncExternalStore pattern verified end-to-end).
- **Q7.3** — BookmarkStore + JournalStore + LinkStore _bump. 4
  consumers migrated (BookmarkIcon, ChapterBookmarkBtn, BookmarksScreen,
  LibraryScreen). LibraryScreen subscribes to ALL 5 stores so the
  5-tile dashboard fully reactive.
- **Q7.4** — NotebookStore + JournalIndexStore _bump. 10 consumers
  migrated (NotesIndexScreen, NotebookManagerSheet, NotebookPickerSheet,
  LinkSidebar, LinkIcon, LinksScreen, HighlightsScreen, JournalHubScreen,
  JournalViewerScreen, JournalChip).

**Stores with `_bump`:** AnnotationStore, NoteStore, BookmarkStore,
JournalStore, LinkStore, NotebookStore, JournalIndexStore (7).

**Exit check:** all production-code Bin 4 disables removed.
`grep -rEn "eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps -- cache-bust"
app/src/main/assets/src --include="*.jsx" --include="*.js" | grep -v test`
returns ZERO matches.

**setHlTick / hlTick prop threading:** still in App() state +
threaded through some non-migrated callbacks (e.g. BookmarksScreen's
post-mutation `setHlTick(t => t + 1)` is now a no-op since no
consumer reads `hlTick`). A follow-up can remove the App-state +
prop entirely; left in place this session to keep blast radius bounded.

### Q8 — Bundle-a.js lazy-load (COMPLETE 2026-05-25)

Cold-boot critical path: **11.7 MB → 1.03 MB (91% reduction)** across
three commits. Pattern proved on books.js (Q8.1), expanded to all
remaining corpora in Q8.2 + Q8.3.

**Q8.1 (`ea94158`)** — books.js split. Cold-boot 11.7 → 4.65 MB.
The 6.9-MB NKJV Bible lives in `bundle-a-bible.js`, loaded on demand
via `window.__loadBibleCorpus()`.

**Q8.2 (`dcd06c3`)** — matthew.js (Study Bible) split. Cold-boot
4.65 → 4.03 MB. Pre-fires on StudiesHome + ScripturesHome mount.
Refactored Q8.1's per-corpus loader into a generic factory:
`window.__makeLazyLoader(name, bundlePath, finishFnName)` →
`{ corpus, load }`. Each corpus exposes `useSyncExternalStore`-
compatible `subscribe / getVersion` + an idempotent `load()`.

**Q8.3 (`5605f30`)** — all VOT corpora (14 files, ~3 MB) split.
Cold-boot 4.03 → 1.03 MB. `bundle-a-vot.js` carries volume-one
through volume-seven + letters-timothy + letters-flock + lords-rebuke
+ wtlb-one + wtlb-two + wtlb-scriptures + the-blessed + holy-days +
hidden-manna. `__finishVotInit` re-runs `linkWtlbEntries` +
`linkPreface` + `VOT_LETTER_REGISTRY` rebuild on load.

Stays critical-path (~1 MB): react + react-dom + html2canvas +
flexsearch + search.js + search-data.js + books-restored.js
(restored-name chrome overrides) + matthew-plain.js (NKJV Matthew,
referenced by inline scripture refs) + matthew-nkjv.js (translation
alternates).

App-side guards added across:
- `app.jsx` — 3 `useSyncExternalStore` subscriptions (one per corpus);
  `ALL_BOOKS` builds sparse if either is undefined.
- `screen-routes.jsx` — `bible-idx / bible-ch / matthew-idx / matthew-ch`
  routes show their own "Loading…" placeholder. The 27 VOT routes
  (volumes + WTLB + Holy Days + Hidden Manna indexes + letters +
  entries) route through `_wrapVot` helper which triggers the
  loader and shows a generic placeholder.
- `HomeScreen` + `VolumesHome` + `ScripturesHome` + `StudiesHome` +
  `SettingsScreen` — `useEffect` pre-fires the relevant loader(s) on
  mount so corpora download in parallel with user's tile scan.
  HomeScreen additionally pre-fires Bible + Matthew + bible-studies
  when `settings.showSurpriseButton` is true (the dice's random-pool
  builder reads all three globals); `use-surprise.js` also
  `typeof`-guards + early-returns on empty pool to make the cold-boot
  race recoverable instead of throwing. The dice button itself now
  flows inline below the last home card (no longer `position:fixed`),
  so the home view scrolls when cards + dice exceed the viewport.
  **Pool scope (2,018 entries):** Matthew Study + Bible + study
  chapters + every COLLECTION with `surpriseType` set (Vols 1–7,
  Timothy, Flock, Rebuke, WTLB 1+2, Blessed, Holy Days) including
  prefaces; Hidden Manna stays out (`surpriseType: null` honors the
  "reachable only via Matthew study chain" policy); "Return to the
  Garden" is not in COLLECTIONS so naturally excluded. Index selection
  uses `crypto.getRandomValues` + rejection-sampling
  (`Math.random` fallback) for bias-free uniform pick.
- `VolumesHome` — `_locked = _votReady && _cnt === 0` so the lock
  flag only kicks in for known-empty collections once the corpus
  arrives (during loading window, NO tile is locked).
- `SettingsScreen` — guards `PROGRESS_GROUPS` on
  `(_BOOKS_READY && _VOT_READY)`. Reads `BOOKS["matthew-plain"]`,
  `LETTERS_V1`, etc. directly inside the array literal so the gate
  prevents evaluation.
- `utils/tabs.js` — `describeTab` reads via `window.BOOKS` and the
  `colLetterArr` typeof-safe accessors. The lazy-safe pattern used
  for years pays off.
- `use-nav-history-tracking.js` — `bible-ch` + `matthew-ch` history-
  record branches early-return if their corpus isn't loaded; a
  later effect re-run picks it up.
- All `LETTERS_X` / `WTLB_X` / `HOLY_DAYS` etc. direct references in
  `screen-routes.jsx` swapped to `colLetterArr(COL_BY_KEY.get(volKey))`
  (lazy-safe via the existing typeof guards in
  `scripture-resolution.js`).

Runtime contract (in `index.html`):
- `__makeLazyLoader(name, bundlePath, finishFnName)` factory.
- `__bibleCorpus / __loadBibleCorpus / __finishBibleInit` (books.js).
- `__matthewCorpus / __loadMatthewCorpus` (matthew.js — no finishInit
  needed since MATTHEW is read only from its own module).
- `__votCorpus / __loadVotCorpus / __finishVotInit` (14 VOT files).

Runtime contract (index.html inline):
- `window.__bibleCorpus = { loaded, subscribe(cb), getVersion() }`
  — React 18 reactivity for the load state.
- `window.__loadBibleCorpus() → Promise` — idempotent injector;
  on-load runs `__finishBibleInit()` which assigns
  `BOOKS["matthew-plain"]`, builds `BIBLE_BOOK_LIST` (66 books in
  canonical order), populates `OT_BOOK_IDS`.

App-side wiring (pattern proof — only books.js this pass):
- ScripturesHome pre-fires `__loadBibleCorpus()` on mount via
  `useEffect`, subscribes to `__bibleCorpus` so tile chapter-counts
  render `'—'` until BOOKS resolves, then fill in real numbers.
- App() subscribes to `__bibleCorpus` at the top level so the WHOLE
  render tree re-runs when BOOKS resolves. `ALL_BOOKS` guards with
  `typeof` to tolerate pre-load state.
- `bible-ch` / `bible-idx` ROUTES entries show a centered "Loading
  Bible…" card if corpus isn't loaded; trigger
  `__loadBibleCorpus()` on render so cold-boot direct to a saved
  Bible chapter tab works.
- `utils/tabs.js` `describeTab` resolves bookId via `window.BOOKS`
  instead of bare `BOOKS` — tolerates undefined cleanly.
- `use-nav-history-tracking.js` skips Bible-chapter history records
  if BOOKS isn't loaded; a subsequent effect run after corpus load
  picks up the entry correctly.

**Remaining work:** other corpus files (matthew.js, volume-*.js,
letters-*, WTLB, the-blessed, holy-days, hidden-manna) stay in
bundle-a for now. Per the pattern-proof discipline established by
earlier phases, expand to other splits in follow-up commits with
their own smoke tests.

### N1 — Native-side polish (CLOSED 2026-05-25)

13 commits bring `MainActivity.kt` to the same quality bar as the JS
side: 10 N1.x items plus 3 post-review hardening commits that closed
real correctness paths found by a critical review pass after N1.10b
landed. Same one-commit-per-item discipline as Q3-Q8; same
build-and-verify-after-each gate.

**New deps** (`gradle/libs.versions.toml`): timber 5.0.1,
kotlinx-coroutines-android 1.10.2, lifecycle-runtime-ktx 2.9.1,
lifecycle-viewmodel-ktx 2.9.1. Zero third-party risk beyond Timber
(Jake Wharton, universally adopted).

**Commit chain:**

- **N1.1 (`f61bb43`)** — Enable WebContents debugging in debug builds.
  `buildFeatures { buildConfig = true }` to re-enable BuildConfig under
  AGP 9.x; `WebView.setWebContentsDebuggingEnabled(true)` gated by
  `BuildConfig.DEBUG`. chrome://inspect attaches on debug APKs; release
  APKs unaffected.
- **N1.2 (`c791381`)** — Timber. New `VOTReaderApp` Application
  subclass plants `Timber.DebugTree()` in debug builds. All 14
  `Log.w("VOTReader", …)` calls → `Timber.w(e, …)`. The
  WebChromeClient console dispatcher fans out to per-level Timber
  calls (e/w/d/i), so the `android.util.Log` import disappears
  entirely. The two duplicate "PermissionRequest resolution failed"
  messages diverge into "grant failed" / "deny failed".
- **N1.3 (`1c3ddaf`)** — Renderer crash recovery. Extract the WebView
  setup into `createConfiguredWebView()` factory. `onRenderProcessGone`
  inside the `WebViewClientCompat` rebuilds the WebView + reloads
  index.html. Tracks `renderRecoveryCount` + `firstRecoveryMs` (60-s
  sliding window); >2 crashes shows a TextView "Tap to reload" rather
  than infinite-looping. Pending mic permission + file chooser
  callback get the same cleanup the dying-Activity path used to do.
- **N1.4 (`4ab52e9`)** — Defensive file reading. `MAX_IMPORT_SIZE = 50 MB`
  on the companion; `querySize(uri)` reads `OpenableColumns.SIZE`
  before `readBytes()`. Rejects oversized + unknown-size files — both
  flow to JS as `__onImportFile(null)`, same code path as cancel /
  read error.
- **N1.5 (`78a5048`)** — Type-safe JS bridge. New `JsBridge` class.
  Three entry points: `callOptional(fn, vararg args)` (escapes
  arguments, posts to WebView thread), `callWithResult(js, callback)`
  (sync return for back-press), `setCssProperties(vararg pairs)` (the
  inset CSS update). 11 raw `evaluateJavascript` sites + their
  `webView.post {}` wrappers collapse into one-line bridge calls. The
  bridge holds a lazy `webViewProvider: () -> WebView` so N1.3's
  WebView recovery doesn't require re-instantiation. JS string source
  construction outside the bridge is structurally impossible.
- **N1.6 (`9a7f5e2`)** — PixelCopy screenshots. `webView.draw(Canvas(…))`
  → `PixelCopy.request`. Captures the actual rendered surface
  (hardware layers included) instead of asking the View to redraw.
  Kept the CountDownLatch + synchronous JS API for this commit
  (N1.7 handles the async cleanup).
- **N1.7 (`f7e6ae0`)** — Coroutines on the screenshot path.
  `suspendCancellableCoroutine` wraps `PixelCopy.request`;
  `withTimeoutOrNull(2_000L)` preserves the 2-s latch cap;
  `invokeOnCancellation` recycles the destination bitmap on timeout
  so an interrupted capture doesn't leak `width*height*4` bytes. The
  `@JavascriptInterface` still returns a String synchronously
  (`runBlocking { withTimeoutOrNull { … } ?: "" }`); JS contract
  unchanged. `CountDownLatch + TimeUnit` imports gone.
- **N1.8 (`54ca4b6`)** — Per-frame IME tracking via
  `WindowInsetsAnimationCompat.Callback`. The existing
  `setOnApplyWindowInsetsListener` fires at start/end of the
  keyboard slide — bottom UI "jumps". The new callback fires at
  ~60 Hz with interpolated insets, updating `--inset-top` /
  `--inset-bottom` per frame so the existing CSS tracks smoothly.
  `onEnd` calls `requestApplyInsets` so the resting state routes
  through the normal listener (which updates the saved Activity-side
  fields for any future `injectInsets` callers). Intentional N1.5
  exception: per-frame inline `evaluateJavascript` (bypasses
  JsBridge for budget reasons; only %.2f-formatted numbers
  interpolated, so quote-injection is structurally impossible).
- **N1.9 (`8bd7e0e`)** — `MainViewModel` (AndroidViewModel). Holds
  the config-change-surviving state: insets, scale, splash hold,
  keep-screen-on, audio session mode, recorder state (later moved
  into NativeAudioRecorder), renderer recovery counters. Every
  reference becomes `vm.X` via bulk substitution. `onCleared` fires
  the recorder release. Manifest's existing `configChanges` covers
  rotation/uiMode/screenSize/etc., so the ViewModel is mostly
  insurance + a single named place for cleanup + future-proofing
  against config changes that escape the manifest list (locale).
- **N1.10a (`9dc4852`)** — Extract `NativeAudioRecorder` (192 lines).
  Six operations (start/pause/resume/amplitude/stop/cancel) + release.
  Returns a small sealed `Result<T>` (Success(value) / Failure(reason))
  matching the JS-side "ok" / "error:<reason>" string contract. Six
  `@JavascriptInterface` recording methods collapse to thin delegates.
  `MainViewModel` holds a single `audioRecorder` instance via
  `AndroidViewModel(application)`. `onCleared` delegates to release.
  MainActivity 1031 → 991 lines.
- **N1.10b (`c27a525`)** — Extract `StorageManager` (116 lines).
  `readUriAsBase64(uri, maxBytes)` (does size check + read + base64
  encode); `writeJsonToDownloads(filename, content)` (the Q+
  MediaStore Downloads path); `queryFileSize(uri)` (the
  OpenableColumns.SIZE query, exposed publicly in case a caller
  wants its own policy). `MAX_IMPORT_SIZE` moves into the companion.
  Returns its own sealed `Result<T>`. MainActivity 991 → 937 lines.

**Post-review hardening (3 commits):** a critical review pass after
N1.10b surfaced three real correctness paths that the build/assemble
gate alone hadn't caught. Each landed as its own commit, same one-fix-
per-commit discipline as the N1.x chain.

- **N1.3 hardening (`d8d0ab6`)** — Dangling `webView` field in the
  retry-view path. `onRenderProcessGone` destroyed the dying WebView
  and then either rebuilt + attached (normal) or called
  `showRendererCrashRetryView` (>2 crashes / 60 s) — but the retry
  branch never reassigned the `webView` field, so JsBridge's lazy
  provider would read the destroyed instance for any in-flight
  callback during the retry-view window (micPrepLauncher result,
  fileChooserCallback, delayed audio-session bridge call). Fix:
  always `webView = createConfiguredWebView()` BEFORE the branch;
  the retry click handler attaches the already-built fresh
  instance instead of constructing another.
- **N1.7 hardening (`1ea0127`)** — PixelCopy bitmap recycle race.
  `invokeOnCancellation { dest.recycle() }` recycled the destination
  bitmap eagerly on coroutine cancellation, but PixelCopy's contract
  requires the bitmap to stay alive "until the callback is invoked."
  Cancellation during a `withTimeoutOrNull` could let the native side
  write into a freed buffer. Fix: invokeOnCancellation just sets an
  `AtomicBoolean`; the PixelCopy callback handles recycle whether the
  coroutine cancelled or completed. IllegalArgumentException path also
  recycles inline (callback won't fire).
- **N1.10b hardening (`ff0f459`)** — `queryFileSize` exception safety.
  `contentResolver.query` can throw SecurityException (revoked URI
  permission) or IllegalStateException (closed provider); the previous
  implementation propagated the exception out of `readUriAsBase64` and
  out of the `filePickerLauncher` callback, crashing the app and
  leaving JS waiting on a never-fired `__onImportFile`. Fix: wrap the
  query in try/catch, return -1L on any exception. Folds into the
  existing "unknown_size" Failure branch — JS contract uniform,
  user sees the standard generic import-failed toast instead of a
  crash.

**Final line counts:** MainActivity 937 + JsBridge 104 + MainViewModel 67
\+ NativeAudioRecorder 192 + StorageManager 116 + VOTReaderApp 19 =
**1,435 lines total** (vs 869-line monolith pre-N1). The growth is
deliberate — each new file owns one concern (logging, JS bridge,
recorder, storage), and MainActivity is now the WebView shell + JS
bridge wiring + lifecycle, with the implementation details delegated.

**Verification:** every commit passed `:app:compileDebugKotlin` +
`:app:compileReleaseKotlin` + `:app:assembleDebug`. JS-side bundles
untouched (Kotlin-only commits don't trip the pre-commit's bundle
rebuild). The post-review hardening pass closed three real correctness
paths (`d8d0ab6` / `1ea0127` / `ff0f459`) before any real-device walk
could trip them; the remaining real-device verification is OWED for:
chrome://inspect attachment (N1.1), chrome://crash recovery (N1.3 +
its retry-view branch from the hardening), PixelCopy capture on
hardware-accelerated content (N1.6), keyboard animation smoothness
(N1.8), recorder survival across orientation change (N1.9), and the
full smoke walk covering import/export/record/screenshot. The Kotlin
wiring is correct; the visual + behavioral proof is owed against an
actual phone.

### Roadmap

**`PLAN.txt`** (repo root) is the strategic working memory — slim, current-state. The active sequence is **W0-W8 (PWA migration + quality hardening)**; full per-phase exit criteria and the 18-critique traceability matrix live there. HISTORY.md has the landed-work chapter. CLAUDE.md is the 30-second briefing.

---

## User policies (durable directives, override defaults)

- **App name is "VOTReader"** (personal app; multi-user-shaped but no auth, no organization).
- **NO AI / NO API KEYS / NO LLM** — deferred indefinitely per user 2026-05-11: *"no ai no nothing, no api keys, etc, those are security risks anyway, we'll defer a.i feature."* The LiteLLM nim-proxy is decommissioned. Do not reintroduce.
- **NO credentials / login / auth anywhere.** All personal data stays local on device.
- **NO security risks** — anything that could leak personal data or LAN-expose a service is a defect, not a polish item.
- `android:allowBackup="false"` — Export/Import in Settings → "Your Data" is the only backup mechanism. JSON file, user-owned, no credentials.
- GitHub identity (**VOTReader** — renamed from corbinlythgoe on 2026-05-28; account email unchanged) and Garden image hosting on GitHub Releases (now `VOTReader/votreader-assets`) are fine for now. Repo went **public** 2026-05-28 for GitHub Pages hosting (W5).
- No Play Store thinking until everything else is done — would also require Timothy's permission first.

**CRITICAL:** Only edit files in `app/src/main/`. Never touch `app/build/`. Always edit D: files, never the C: junction or the `app.OLD-*` backup.

## Working-directory health check (run after fresh clone)

```sh
# 1. activate the pre-commit hook
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
# 2. install Node deps (node_modules/ is gitignored)
npm install
# 3. verify the toolchain
node --version    # expect v20+
npx esbuild --version    # expect 0.28+
# 4. rebuild bundles from source (proves the build pipeline works)
npm run build
# 5. preview: serve via tools/preview-server.py (NOT plain python -m http.server)
#    .claude/launch.json already points the preview tool at it.
#    Open index.html, paste tools/smoke.js into preview_eval, call votSmoke()
#    expect PASS line: globals ok, data ok, screens 0 crashed,
#    letterAnn ok, wtlbAnn ok, console.error 0, resource404 0
```

If Node is missing on Windows: `winget install OpenJS.NodeJS.LTS`. Use bash/git-bash for npm commands (PowerShell execution policy blocks `npm.ps1`).

**Preview cache gotcha:** `tools/preview-server.py` sends `Cache-Control: no-store` so reloads always fetch fresh bundles. The plain `python -m http.server` caches `dist/bundle-*.js` heuristically and serves stale bundles after a rebuild — don't use it.

## Quick start: app failed to load? read this first

If the app shows a black screen, run the validator:

```bash
pip install esprima  # one-time
python D:/VOTReader-studio/check_balance.py
```

It checks every data file for:
1. **esprima JS parse errors** (authoritative — catches real syntax bugs)
2. **Non-ASCII dashes (en/em) in verse ranges** like `12:18–20` — breaks the renderer's parseRefRange regex, so Unicode superscripts render as **white inline text** instead of gold sup
3. **Smart quotes** (`" " ' '`) used as JSON delimiters instead of ASCII `" '`

These are the three classes of bugs that brace-counting alone misses and any of which causes a black-screen failure or wrong rendering.

### Black-screen failure modes seen in this project

| Symptom | Root cause | Example | How to detect |
|---|---|---|---|
| Black screen at app start | Unescaped `"` inside JSON string value | `"Psalm 50:7": ""Hear, O My people..."" ` | esprima parse error |
| Black screen at app start | Unicode smart quotes used as delimiters | `"t": "text",` | esprima / `check_balance.py` |
| Verse numbers render as **white inline text** instead of gold sup | En dash `–` instead of hyphen `-` in verse range | `Exodus 12:18–20` | `check_balance.py` dash check |
| Footnote sheet shows blank cite | Translation tag mismatch in `nkjv` dict key | `"John 14:6 (CJB)"` not in nkjv | manual verify |
| Tap-through to wrong letter | Letter-link `letterTitle` misattributed | linked to "Subject to No Man" but content is from "A Just God and A Savior" | `misattribution_check.py` |

---

## Permanent rules (never violate)

1. **Verse ranges always use ASCII hyphen `-`**, never en dash `–` or em dash `—`. Affects `chapter:verse-verse` strings in keys, refs, labels, cites — anywhere the renderer parses a verse range. The em dash is fine **only** as separator in compound nkjv values: `"Exodus 12:6 — verse text | Exodus 12:18-20 — verse text"`.

2. **All JSON-style delimiters are ASCII `"`** (or `'` if you must). Smart quotes go INSIDE string values only, where they're typographic content. If a string value contains a literal ASCII `"`, escape it: `\"`.

3. **Run `check_balance.py` after every batch edit.** Single-file edits via `Edit` tool generally don't introduce these, but agent-generated content frequently does (especially OCR-style transcription). The versioned pre-commit hook at `.githooks/pre-commit` does this automatically when any `app/src/main/assets/src/data/*.js` is staged, and runs `npm run build` to regenerate bundles when any bundle-source file is staged. Emergency bypass: `git commit --no-verify` (not recommended).

4. **Footnote NKJV text uses decimal verse markers** (`"19. text 20. text"`) for multi-verse refs, never Unicode superscripts (`¹⁹text ²⁰text`). The `verse-sup` gold inlay rendering only fires when the decimal or superscript-with-clean-range strategy succeeds. Mixed formats fall through to the white-text fallback.

5. **Blob consumption: never `readAsArrayBuffer()` for large data.** Use `URL.createObjectURL(blob)` for audio/video playback and image display. Use `blob.stream()` for streaming reads. Use `blob.slice()` for partial reads. NEVER use `FileReader.readAsArrayBuffer()` or `FileReader.readAsDataURL()` on blobs >1 MB — it loads the entire blob into heap and will OOM on budget devices (2-3 GB RAM). The only exception is the export path (W2.6), which processes blobs sequentially with explicit size guards.

6. **esbuild MUST keep `--target=chrome69` on build:b/c/d.** minSdk 26 (Android 8) ships a System WebView as old as Chromium ~58, and a non-Play-updated Android 9 is Chromium 69 (verified on an API-28 emulator 2026-06-01). Without the target, esbuild emits raw `?.` / `??` / etc. — modern SYNTAX that is a hard PARSE error on those WebViews, killing the whole bundle → total black screen (not a graceful degrade). The floor is **69, not lower**, because the app uses `Array.flatMap` (a Chromium-69 *runtime* API esbuild can't transpile) — below 69 it fails anyway. Any runtime API newer than C69 (e.g. `Promise.allSettled` C76, `Promise.any` C85, `globalThis` C71) needs a feature-detected polyfill in the FIRST `<script>` of index.html, NOT a target bump. Removing the target or using a too-new API without a shim re-breaks Android 8/9 silently (desktop + modern Android hide it). See the 2026-06-01 current-state bullet.

---

## Editing principles

1. **Edit > Write.** Use the Edit tool for surgical changes. Reserve Write for new files.
2. **Read before Edit.** Always Read the target file region first.
3. **No regex at file scope.** User has been burned by this. Local string replacements only.
4. **Preserve other letters.** When editing letter N in a multi-letter file, only touch letter N.
5. **Verify after agent runs.** Diff or re-read the section. Trust but verify.
6. **No new Holy Days originals.** Holy Days is curated cross-references; do not author new content.
7. **Format-preserving.** Volume Two uses unquoted JS keys (`id: "..."`); old volumes use quoted JSON-style (`"id": "..."`). Match the file's existing format.
8. **No bandaid renderers.** If text is broken, fix the source data, not the renderer.
9. **Footnote audience:**
   - Volumes (Format A) → numbered gold bubbles → tap → bottom sheet w/ NKJV verse
   - WTLB / Blessed (Format B) → inline `(Book X:Y)` parenthetical cite → tap → bottom sheet w/ NKJV verse
   - Holy Days entries inherit Format A or B based on `entry.type`

### Anti-patterns (NOT to do)

- Run regex `sed`/`grep -E` at file scope to "patch" footnotes
- Add a CSS bandaid for white verse numbers — fix the data or renderer instead
- Author new Letters that don't exist on the live website
- Use Hidden Manna entries in any public index, search, or home tile
- Add `metaAddendum` fields to letters that don't have an "Also read" on the live site
- Change Volume Two's format (it's the gold standard)
- Mix numbered footnote bubbles with inline `(Ref)` cites in the same letter
- Skip the Read-before-Edit verification

## Data formats — collection-by-collection

### Format A: Rich JSON-style (Volumes 1-7, Lord's Rebuke, Letters to Flock, Letters from Timothy, Hidden Manna)

### Format B: Simple paragraph (WTLB One, WTLB Two, The Blessed)

```js
{
  "id": "matters-of-the-heart",
  "num": 11,
  "title": "Matters of the Heart",
  "paragraphs": [
    { "align": "center", "text": "The wailing of the penitent\nBrings forth healing;" },

  "prevEntry": { "id": "...", "title": "..." } | null,    // (used in HOLY_DAYS only)
  "nextEntry": { "id": "...", "title": "..." } | null
}
```

**Inline patterns inside `text`:**
- `_italic_` (single underscore)
- `**bold**` (double asterisk)
- `{{ref:Book Chapter:Verse}}` — tappable scripture popup
- `{{nav:bookId:chapter}}` — navigate to Bible chapter (e.g. `{{nav:esther:7}}`)
- `†` — section divider character (The Blessed)
- `~ [From "Letter Title" ~ Volume X]` — attribution at end of WTLB entry (tap-through wired)

### Format C: Bible book (books.js, books-restored.js, matthew.js, bible-*.js)

```js
{
  "id": "ephesians", "title": "Ephesians",

    { "num": 1, "title": "...", "sections": [{ "heading": "...", "verses": [{ "n": 1, "text": "..." }] }] }
  ]
}
```

### Format D: Bible Studies (bible-studies.js)

Multi-part studies with chapters. Each study has `parts[].chapterIds[]` referencing chapter entries. Lazy-loaded — saves 4.3 MB from cold-boot.
